  This comprehensive review provides an in-depth analysis of current therapeutic approaches for atopic dermatitis, integrating findings from recent biologic studies. The review categorizes therapeutic targets into several key areas: (1) Immune System Targets including Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), JAK/STAT pathway, innate immune alarmins (TSLP, IL-33), OX40-OX40L pathway, and Th17/Th22 pathways; (2) Pruritus Mechanisms targeting IL-31 pathway, histamine receptors, and neurokinin 1 receptor; (3) Skin Microbiome Modulation using bacteriotherapy. The review emphasizes that while current therapies effectively target Th2 cytokines and JAK/STAT pathways, emerging strategies focus on upstream targets (OX40/OX40L, IL-31) and personalized approaches based on AD endotypes.

title: "Blocking the IL-4/IL-13 Axis versus the JAK/STAT Pathway in Atopic Dermatitis"

journal: "PMC"
doi: "10.3390/ijms25137037"

  This review compares two main treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis: IL-4/IL-13 axis targeting (monoclonal antibodies like dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab) versus JAK/STAT pathway targeting (JAK inhibitors like upadacitinib, abrocitinib). Key differences include: IL-4/13 mAbs specifically block key Th2 cytokines, while JAK inhibitors work more broadly by inhibiting intracellular signaling for multiple cytokines. JAK inhibitors demonstrate faster onset of action, particularly for itch relief and achieving high skin clearance levels. Safety profiles differ significantly: IL-4/13 mAbs are associated with ocular surface disease, while JAK inhibitors carry risks of infections, venous thromboembolism, and malignancy. The choice between approaches depends on patient-specific factors including phenotype, comorbidities, and molecular endotype.

  This review highlights the translational revolution in atopic dermatitis, where deeper understanding of pathogenesis has led to an expanded therapeutic pipeline. Key molecular targets include: Th2 pathway (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, TSLP, OX40/OX40L), JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Th22 pathway (IL-22), phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), and pruritus-related targets (IL-31, OSMRβ, H4R, NK1R, KORs). Approved therapies include biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab), JAK inhibitors (abrocitinib, upadacitinib, ruxolitinib), and topical treatments (crisaborole, tapinarof). The field is moving toward personalized medicine using biomarkers to stratify patients based on their unique immune fingerprint and molecular endotypes.

  This review focuses on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. In the acute phase of AD, production of various Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 results in barrier dysfunction. The JAK-STAT pathway serves as a master regulator that mediates signaling for multiple cytokines involved in AD inflammation. The review discusses how JAK inhibitors can block signaling for these cytokines and provide effective treatment for AD by targeting multiple inflammatory pathways simultaneously.

  This review evaluates recently approved drugs and emerging targets for atopic dermatitis treatment. It discusses therapeutic targets that can be addressed to improve eczematous lesions and pruritus, including established targets like IL-4/IL-13 and emerging targets such as IL-31, TSLP, OX40, and IL-33. The review provides an overview of the current therapeutic landscape and identifies promising new directions in AD treatment.

title: "OX40 in the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis—A New Therapeutic Target"
authors: ["M Croft"]
year: 2024
journal: "PMC"
doi: "10.3390/ijms25084242"
citation_key: "croft2024"

  This review examines OX40 as a new therapeutic target in atopic dermatitis. Sensory neurons express receptors for various cytokines released by skin cells and immune cells, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and TSLP, to transmit pruritus. The OX40-OX40L pathway represents an upstream target that regulates T-cell activation and survival. Factors that upregulate OX40L include alarmin cytokines such as TSLP and IL-33, produced by keratinocytes, whose expression is enhanced in AD. Targeting this pathway offers a promising approach for modulating the immune response in AD.
