  Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 20% of children and 10% of adults globally. In the US, prevalence is approximately 18% in school-aged children and 7% in adults. The disease significantly impairs quality of life, leading to limited lifestyle, avoidance of social interaction, impacted daily activities, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and substantial economic burden (up to 10% of annual household income).

  AD pathogenesis is primarily driven by Type 2 inflammation, with key cytokines including IL-13 (the most dominant), IL-4, IL-5, and IL-31. This immune dysregulation leads to skin barrier impairment, chronic pruritus, and dysbiosis of the skin microbiome. IL-13 plays a significant role in driving both skin barrier impairment and dysbiosis, and its levels correlate with disease severity.

  The treatment landscape includes preventative management with moisturizers for mild AD, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and newer non-steroidal options. For moderate-to-severe AD, systemic therapies include biologics targeting specific pathways (dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, nemolizumab) and oral JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, abrocitinib). Targeted systemic therapies are now strongly recommended as first-line options for moderate-to-severe disease.

  Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic-relapsing, inflammatory, and intensely itchy eczematous skin disorder characterized by pruritus (most typical symptom), skin lesions that vary by age (infantile, childhood, adult phases), and clinical variants including head and neck dermatitis, hand eczema, and nummular eczema.

  Major unmet needs include:
  1. Diagnosis: Lack of specific serum biomarkers, reliance on clinician experience, difficulty diagnosing adult-onset AD
  2. Management and Prognosis: No reliable serological markers to predict disease course or prognosis
  3. Treatment: Suboptimal response to current targeted therapies (only ~40% of patients on dupilumab achieve complete/near-complete response), need for more effective alternative targeted treatments including oral medications, lack of clear definition of disease remission and standardized treatment goals

  A substantial percentage of patients do not respond optimally to currently approved targeted therapies, highlighting the need for more effective and diverse treatment options.

  Moderate-to-severe AD imposes a significant burden on patients, causing dramatic impact on quality of life for both patients and families, significant psychological disorders including anxiety and mood disorders, functional impairment, and major consequences on career, work productivity, social relationships, and financial burden.

  Clinical management involves stepped approach from topicals to systemics, with diagnosis relying on clinical criteria and severity assessment using SCORAD and EASI scores. Treatment pathway includes topical therapy, phototherapy, and systemic therapy with dupilumab considered as first-line systemic treatment when available.

  Unmet treatment needs are pronounced, with current topical therapies and immune response modifiers insufficient, significant burden of adverse events with off-label immunosuppressants, and unanimous consensus on the need for novel topical and systemic agents that offer prolonged remission and safe side-effect profile for long-term treatment. There are no generally accepted criteria for defining treatment failure.
