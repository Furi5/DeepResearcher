  JAK inhibitors work by blocking the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, which modulates several immune pathways (T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cells) involved in AD pathogenesis. JAK1 and JAK3 mediate signaling for cytokines like IL-4 and IL-31, which are relevant to AD inflammation and chronic pruritus. The three oral JAK inhibitors - abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib - demonstrate high efficacy in clinical trials with rapid onset of action (symptomatic relief observed as early as 1-2 weeks). They are effective at achieving both short-term symptomatic relief and improving disease severity, with significant improvements in EASI scores and clear/almost clear skin rates. Head-to-head trials suggest JAK inhibitors may have slightly numerical superiority in efficacy and faster onset compared to dupilumab. Safety considerations include common side effects (nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, acne) and serious risks (infections, thromboembolic events, laboratory abnormalities, malignancies).

  JAK inhibitors show varying selectivity profiles: Abrocitinib is ~28-fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2 (JAK1: 0.029 μM, JAK2: 0.803 μM), targeting cytokines crucial for AD inflammation and pruritus. Upadacitinib is ~2.5-fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2 (JAK1: 47 nM, JAK2: 120 nM), demonstrating superior efficacy in clinical trials. Baricitinib lacks selectivity (JAK1: 5.9 nM, JAK2: 5.7 nM), providing broad anti-inflammatory action but associated with higher risk of hematological side effects. Delgocitinib is a pan-JAK inhibitor (JAK1: 2.8 nM, JAK2: 2.6 nM, JAK3: 13 nM, TYK2: 58 nM) approved as topical ointment to minimize systemic exposure. Ruxolitinib (JAK1: 6.4 nM, JAK2: 8.8 nM) cream formulation provides targeted relief with limited systemic absorption. JAK1-selective inhibitors are highly effective because JAK1 is the primary signaling pathway for multiple cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, while selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 may reduce hematological adverse events.

  Phase 3 trial results: At Week 12, IGA response (clear/almost clear) was 48.4% with 200 mg abrocitinib, 36.6% with 100 mg abrocitinib, and 14.0% with placebo (P<0.001). EASI-75 response was 70.3% with 200 mg, 58.7% with 100 mg, and 27.1% with placebo (P<0.001). The 200 mg dose of abrocitinib was superior to dupilumab for itch response at Week 2. For most other key secondary endpoints at Week 16, neither abrocitinib dose differed significantly from dupilumab. Safety findings: Most common adverse events were nausea (11.1% with 200 mg, 4.2% with 100 mg), acne (6.6% with 200 mg, 2.9% with 100 mg), and herpes zoster (1.8% with 200 mg, 0.8% with 100 mg). Dose-dependent decreases in platelet counts were observed, but no patient had count below 75,000 per cubic millimeter. Incidence of conjunctivitis was lower with abrocitinib (1.3% and 0.8%) than with dupilumab (6.2%). No deaths, major cardiovascular adverse events, or thromboembolic events occurred.

  Phase 3 trials (INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2) involving 1,337 patients (ages 6 and older) with mild to moderate AD. Roflumilast is a highly potent, once-daily topical PDE4 inhibitor with significantly higher potency (approximately 25-fold to more than 300-fold) than other PDE4 inhibitors like crisaborole in vitro. Efficacy: Primary endpoint (vIGA-AD Success) at week 4: INTEGUMENT-1: 32.0% (roflumilast) vs. 15.2% (vehicle); INTEGUMENT-2: 28.9% vs. 12.0%. EASI-75 at week 4: INTEGUMENT-1: 43.2% vs. 22.0%; INTEGUMENT-2: 42.0% vs. 19.7%. Statistically significant itch reduction observed as early as 24 hours after first application. Safety: Low adverse event rates similar to vehicle (any TEAE: 21.2-22.6% vs. 13.0-15.8%). Excellent local tolerability with >95% of patients having no signs of irritation at application site and >90% reporting no or mild sensation. No patients who had previously discontinued crisaborole due to stinging/burning reported application-site pain with roflumilast.

  Crisaborole is a nonsteroidal topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor containing a boron atom that competitively and reversibly binds to the bimetallic center of PDE4 enzyme, inhibiting its activity. PDE4 inhibition leads to increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which negatively regulates proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, thereby reducing skin inflammation. Efficacy: In phase III trials (AD-301 and AD-302), approximately 32.8% and 31.4% of crisaborole-treated patients achieved treatment success (ISGA score of clear or almost clear with ≥2-grade improvement) at day 29, significantly superior to vehicle. Safety: Limited adverse event profile with low systemic absorption. Most common adverse event was application site pain (stinging, burning) at approximately 4% incidence, with 78% of reported application site pain resolving within 1 day of onset. 94% of adverse events were mild to moderate. Long-term 48-week safety study showed consistent adverse event rates with key trials. Application site pain incidence (4%) was lower than topical calcineurin inhibitors (20%-58% for tacrolimus, 8%-26% for pimecrolimus) but higher than topical corticosteroids (<1% to 6%).

  Network meta-analysis comparing JAK inhibitors for AD treatment. Abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib were consistently effective therapies in adult and adolescent patients with AD. Upadacitinib 30 mg may be the most efficacious treatment for short-term induction of clinical response in moderate-to-severe AD. All three JAK inhibitors demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo across multiple endpoints including EASI-75, IGA response, and pruritus improvement. The analysis provides comparative effectiveness data to inform treatment selection in clinical practice, highlighting the rapid onset of action and high efficacy rates of these small molecule inhibitors in AD management.

  Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors target individual receptor-associated kinases, thereby preventing the mediation of inflammatory signals. Several JAK inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials for atopic dermatitis by modulating key inflammatory pathways involved in the disease pathogenesis. The JAK/STAT pathway plays a crucial role in the cytokine signaling that drives AD inflammation, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Different JAK inhibitors exhibit varying selectivity profiles that influence their efficacy and safety profiles in AD treatment.

  Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) regulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate in cells and has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of AD, making it an important therapeutic target. PDE4 inhibition represents a novel approach to AD treatment by modulating intracellular cAMP levels and downstream inflammatory signaling pathways. The development of PDE4 inhibitors has provided new treatment options for patients with mild to moderate AD who may not be candidates for systemic therapies or who prefer topical treatments.
