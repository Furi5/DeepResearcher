  This landmark phase 3 study (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 trials) evaluated dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At week 16, dupilumab significantly improved IGA scores (clear or almost clear): 37-38% vs 10% in SOLO 1, and 36% vs 8% in SOLO 2 compared to placebo. EASI-75 response rates were also significantly higher with dupilumab. Safety profile was acceptable with injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis being the most common adverse events. Skin infections were less frequent in dupilumab groups.

  The ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 phase 3 trials evaluated tralokinumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. At week 16, IGA 0/1 responses were 15.8% vs 7.1% (ECZTRA 1) and 22.2% vs 10.9% (ECZTRA 2) compared to placebo. EASI-75 responses were 25.0% vs 12.7% (ECZTRA 1) and 33.2% vs 11.4% (ECZTRA 2). Adverse events were similar between groups, and most responders maintained efficacy through 52 weeks without rescue medications.

  Phase 3 trials demonstrated lebrikizumab efficacy in moderate-to-severe AD. At week 16, IGA 0/1 responses were 43.1% vs 12.7% (Trial 1) and 33.2% vs 10.8% (Trial 2) compared to placebo. EASI-75 responses were 58.8% vs 16.2% (Trial 1) and 52.1% vs 18.1% (Trial 2). Significant improvements in itch and sleep interference were observed. Conjunctivitis was more frequent with lebrikizumab (7.4-7.5% vs 2.1-2.8%), while skin infections were less frequent.
