  This scoping review summarizes current evidence on OX40/OX40L inhibition in moderate-to-severe AD. Key findings from Phase 1-2 trials include:
  
  **Amlitelimab (anti-OX40L):** Phase 2a showed ~80% and ~70% EASI improvement for low/high doses vs ~49% placebo at week 16. Phase 2b (STREAM-AD) demonstrated statistically significant EASI improvements across all four subcutaneous dose regimens at week 16 with sustained effects through week 24. Well-tolerated with common TEAEs including headache, URI, pyrexia, and hyperhidrosis.
  
  **Rocatinlimab (anti-OX40):** Phase 2b showed 48-61% EASI improvement vs 15% placebo at week 16, with 300 mg Q2W achieving 88% improvement by week 36. Notable for sustained treatment effect with low relapse rates (4-27%) after treatment cessation. Well-tolerated with pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, chills, and headache as common TEAEs.
  
  **Telazorlimab (anti-OX40):** Phase 2b demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy with 300 mg Q2W and 600 mg Q2W showing 54% and 59% EASI improvement vs placebo. TEAEs comparable to placebo with nasopharyngitis, URI, and headache.

  Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study of amlitelimab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Amlitelimab treatment significantly reduced clinical and biomarker responses and was well tolerated through week 52. The study demonstrated sustained efficacy and safety profile supporting further development of OX40/OX40L pathway inhibition for AD treatment.

  Clinical trials of itepekimab (anti-IL-33) in moderate-to-severe AD were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Two studies (dose-ranging NCT03738423 and proof-of-concept NCT03736967) showed no meaningful clinical benefit either as monotherapy or in combination with dupilumab. Despite successful target engagement (increased total IL-33 levels) and expected pharmacodynamic effects (reduced eosinophil counts), itepekimab demonstrated no clinical efficacy. The drug was generally well-tolerated with most TEAEs being mild to moderate. These findings suggest IL-33 may not be a primary pathogenic driver in chronic moderate-to-severe AD.

  Randomized, double-blind, phase 2a trial of fezakinumab in moderate-to-severe AD. In the entire population, primary endpoint (SCORAD at week 12) was not statistically significant (-13.8 vs -8.0 placebo, p=0.134). However, in severe AD patients (SCORAD ≥50), fezakinumab showed significant improvements: SCORAD decline at week 12 (-21.6 vs -9.6 placebo, p=0.029) and week 20 (-27.4 vs -11.5, p=0.010). Body surface area improvement was significant in both overall and severe populations. Fezakinumab was well-tolerated with safety profile similar to placebo. Most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections.
