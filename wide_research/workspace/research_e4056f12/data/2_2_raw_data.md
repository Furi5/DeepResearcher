  Filaggrin contributes to skin barrier function through two primary mechanisms: (1) Structural role in keratinocyte compaction - filaggrin monomers bind to keratin intermediate filaments, causing them to aggregate into dense macrofibrils that facilitate formation of flattened corneocytes; (2) Formation of Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) - filaggrin breakdown products (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, urocanic acid) maintain skin hydration. FLG loss-of-function mutations disrupt both functions, leading to impaired stratum corneum structure, reduced skin hydration, enhanced allergen penetration, and triggering of aberrant immune responses that characterize atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.

  Tight junction dysfunction in AD is primarily driven by inflammatory cytokines: Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13) down-regulate claudin-1 expression; IFN-γ decreases claudin-1 in dose- and time-dependent manner; IL-17 inhibits synthesis of ZO-1, claudin-1, and claudin-4; IL-33 down-regulates claudin-1 in keratinocytes. Claudin-1 is the most prominently implicated claudin, with its reduction being a key risk factor for AD. The severity of AD phenotype correlates directly with claudin-1 deficiency levels. Claudin-1 deficiency leads to dysfunctional tight junctions in stratum granulosum, impairing stratum corneum formation by altering pH, lipid processing, and filaggrin maturation.

  Main components of the skin barrier are located in the outer layers of the epidermis including filaggrin and tight junction proteins. The review emphasizes that skin barrier dysfunction in AD involves multiple components beyond just filaggrin mutations, including tight junction proteins, lipid composition abnormalities, and protease-antiprotease imbalances. These components work in an integrated manner to maintain epidermal barrier integrity.

  FLG loss-of-function mutations increase the risk of atopic dermatitis. In infants, FLG mutations were associated with impaired skin barrier function (increased transepidermal water loss) at 6 months of age and increased risk for eczema and dry skin from 3 months of age. The study confirms that FLG mutations contribute to early-onset skin barrier dysfunction that predisposes to AD development.

  Tight junctions reside immediately below the stratum corneum and regulate selective permeability of the paracellular pathway. Impaired TJ barrier function in AD lesions correlates with claudin-1 levels. The study establishes that tight junction defects represent an important component of the epidermal barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis, working in conjunction with stratum corneum abnormalities.

  The transmembrane protein claudin-1 is a major component of epidermal tight junctions, creating a dynamic paracellular barrier in the skin. The study demonstrates that claudin-1 decrease in AD lesions impacts epidermal barrier function in a dose-dependent manner, with greater claudin-1 reduction correlating with more severe barrier impairment.

  Mutations in the Filaggrin gene can cause absent or reduced filaggrin protein, leading to impaired keratinization and skin barrier defect. The review discusses how FLG mutations disrupt the normal process of keratinocyte differentiation and barrier formation, contributing to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis through multiple mechanisms including structural impairment and reduced natural moisturizing factor production.

  The study examines mechanisms of abnormal lamellar body secretion and the integrated dysfunction of multiple skin barrier components in atopic dermatitis. It highlights how defects in lipid processing and secretion contribute to the overall barrier impairment, working in conjunction with filaggrin and tight junction abnormalities to create the characteristic skin barrier defect in AD.

  Epidermal barrier dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of Atopic Dermatitis pathogenesis. The review discusses how skin barrier defects represent not just a consequence but a primary driver of AD, with filaggrin mutations and tight junction abnormalities working synergistically to create a permeable barrier that allows allergen penetration and immune activation.

  The review describes how filaggrin, tight junctions, and lipid barriers work as "three musketeers" - all for one and one for all - to provide a highly organized skin barrier. Major players in stratum corneum barrier dysfunction include filaggrin mutations, but the integrated dysfunction of multiple barrier components creates the vulnerability to cutaneous sensitization and atopic disease development.
