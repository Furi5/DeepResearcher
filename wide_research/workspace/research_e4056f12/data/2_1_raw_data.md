  This comprehensive review discusses the evidence linking Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to atopic dermatitis (AD). IL-4 is critical for initiating the Th2 immune response and directly impairing the skin barrier by downregulating filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin expression through the STAT6 pathway. IL-13 drives chronic skin changes, remodeling, and inflammation, with effects that overlap and extend those of IL-4. IL-31 is primarily associated with inducing pruritus in AD, as its receptor is highly expressed on sensory neurons. IL-31 directly activates these nerve fibers to cause itching and can also activate eosinophils and keratinocytes, contributing to the inflammatory milieu.

  This review details how the JAK-STAT signaling pathway mediates the effects of Th2 cytokines in atopic dermatitis. IL-4 signals through Type I (JAK1/JAK3/STAT6) and Type II (JAK1/TYK2/STAT3/STAT6) receptors, leading to skin barrier dysfunction and inflammation. IL-13 primarily signals through the Type II IL-4 receptor (JAK1/TYK2/STAT3/STAT6), contributing to barrier defects and inflammation. IL-31 binds to IL-31Rα/OSMRβ receptor complex, activating JAK1/JAK2 and phosphorylating STAT3/STAT5, which drives pruritus and promotes nerve elongation. The JAK-STAT pathway is the central signaling cascade that translates cytokine binding into intracellular signals regulating inflammation, skin barrier dysfunction, and pruritus in AD.

  This seminal study demonstrated that IL-31 mRNA levels correlate with IL-4 and IL-13 expression but not with IFN-gamma in atopic dermatitis. The research established IL-31 as a Th2-associated cytokine and showed its enhanced expression in both atopic and allergic contact dermatitis, providing early evidence for its role in inflammatory skin diseases.

  This review highlights the distinct roles and differential expression patterns of IL-4 and IL-13 in type-2 inflammation. IL-4 is primarily responsible for the humoral immune response (IgE production, mast cell activation) and is mainly produced by follicular helper T cells in lymphoid tissues. IL-13 drives the peripheral tissue response (mucus production, goblet cell hyperplasia, tissue remodeling) and is produced by conventional Th2 cells and ILC2s at inflammatory sites. This functional and spatial separation allows for distinct arms of type-2 inflammation to operate in atopic dermatitis.

  This study demonstrates that STAT3 plays a critical dual role in IL-31 receptor signaling and pruritus in atopic dermatitis. STAT3 is required for constitutive expression of the IL-31 receptor (IL-31RA and OSMR) in sensory neurons. IL-31 injection rapidly induces nuclear accumulation of activated STAT3 in itch-transmitting sensory neurons. Genetic deletion of STAT3 in sensory neurons virtually abolished the itch response to IL-31 and strongly reduced pruritus in an atopic dermatitis model, indicating that STAT3 is essential for both IL-31-dependent and independent inflammatory itch.

  This research established that IL-31 production is induced by IL-4 and promotes Th2-driven inflammation. The study showed that transgenic mice engineered to overexpress IL-31 develop atopic dermatitis-like symptoms including alopecia, pruritis, and skin inflammation, providing direct evidence for IL-31's role in AD pathogenesis.

  This review discusses the novel pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis focusing on cytokines in the skin. It emphasizes that IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 are proinflammatory cytokines mainly produced by type 2 helper T (Th2) cells and are classified as Th2 cytokines. These cytokines work in concert to create the characteristic inflammation and barrier dysfunction in AD.

  This comprehensive review discusses current knowledge about the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in atopic dermatitis pathology. It highlights that cytokines signaling via the JAK-STAT pathway (including IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, and IL-31) contribute to both immune-mediated mechanisms and skin barrier alterations in AD. The review emphasizes the therapeutic implications of targeting this pathway.

  This recent review discusses the complex interplay of cytokines in atopic dermatitis pathophysiology. It notes that ILC2 cells produce IL-5 and IL-13, while Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and IL-5. In the chronic phase, not only Th2 cells but also other immune cells contribute to the cytokine network, creating a complex inflammatory environment in AD skin.

  This review focuses on IL-31 as a clinical target for pruritus treatment in atopic dermatitis. It discusses that elevated levels of IL-31 or its receptor have been reported in the tissue or serum of patients with pruritic skin diseases, particularly atopic dermatitis. The review emphasizes IL-31's central role in mediating itch and its potential as a therapeutic target for AD treatment.
