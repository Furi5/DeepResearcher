  This study provides the atomic-level structures of phosphorylated STAT6 core fragment homodimer, both in DNA-free state and complexed with N4 or N3 DNA binding sites. Key findings include:
  - STAT6 core fragment consists of five structural modules: N-terminal coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker domain, SH2 domain, and C-terminal phosphotyrosine tail segment
  - STAT6 exhibits a dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding, with the DNA-binding domain undergoing significant rotation
  - STAT6 uniquely prefers N4 site DNA (TTCN4GAA) over N3 site, primarily governed by residue H415 in the DNA-binding domain
  - The SH2 domain mediates reciprocal dimerization through binding to phosphorylated tyrosine Y641
  - STAT6 dimer has a larger interface angle compared to other STAT proteins, providing structural flexibility for DNA recognition

  This study further elucidates STAT6's structural basis for N4 DNA preference:
  - STAT6 as a transcription factor forms dimers upon phosphorylation in the cytoplasm
  - The phosphorylated STAT6 dimers translocate into the nucleus and bind specific DNA response elements
  - The unique DNA recognition mechanism involves specific conformational changes that accommodate the longer N4 spacer
  - Structural comparisons reveal key differences in DNA-binding domain architecture compared to other STAT family members

  This seminal study provides comprehensive mutational analysis of the STAT6 SH2 domain:
  - The SH2 domain serves dual functions: receptor recruitment and dimerization
  - Mutations in specific residues of the SH2 domain affect STAT6 dimerization and DNA binding
  - The study identifies critical residues essential for proper STAT6 function
  - Mutational analysis reveals that defects in dimerization prevent formation of functional DNA binding domains

  This early study established the fundamental signaling mechanism:
  - IL-4 and IL-13 each induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase
  - Both cytokines induce binding of Stat6 to DNA
  - The study demonstrates the conserved signaling pathway between IL-4 and IL-13
  - Provides evidence for JAK2 involvement in STAT6 activation

  This comprehensive review details STAT6 activation mechanisms:
  - IL-4 binding to type I receptor complex phosphorylates JAK1/3
  - JAK kinases phosphorylate tyrosines within the IL-4Rα cytoplasmic domain
  - These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for STAT6 SH2 domains
  - STAT6 is then phosphorylated at tyrosine 641, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation
