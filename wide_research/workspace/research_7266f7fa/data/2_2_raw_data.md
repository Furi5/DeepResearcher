  This seminal study demonstrated that STAT6 is essential for Th2 cell development. Stat6-deficient T lymphocytes fail to differentiate into Th2 cells in response to either IL-4 or IL-13. The study also showed that STAT6 is required for key IL-4 responses including IL-4-induced increases in cell surface expression of MHC class II antigens and IL-4 receptor, lymphocyte proliferation in response to IL-4, and IgE production following in vivo immunization. These findings established STAT6 as the critical transcription factor for mediating cellular responses to IL-4 and IL-13.

  This comprehensive review details the molecular mechanisms of STAT6 transcriptional regulation. STAT6 is activated by IL-4 and IL-13, forming homodimers that bind to specific DNA sequences (TTC(N)2–4 GAA). It collaborates with other transcription factors including NF-κB (for IgE class switching), C/EBPβ (for FIZZ1 and arginase 1 regulation), PU.1, AP-1, and STAT3. STAT6 recruits an enhanceosome complex containing coactivators like CBP/p300, NCoA-1, p100/SND1, RNA Helicase A, and PARP-14, which functions as a transcriptional switch by recruiting HDACs for repression and then relieving repression upon IL-4 stimulation.

  This article describes both STAT6-dependent and independent mechanisms in Th2 polarization. The primary STAT6-dependent pathway involves IL-4/STAT6 signaling that promotes GATA3 expression. STAT6-independent mechanisms include: Notch signaling (via Jagged ligands) that directly promotes GATA3-1a and IL4 expression; IL-2/STAT5 pathway that induces IL-4 in a GATA3-independent manner; Wnt signaling (via TCF-1) that stimulates GATA3-1b expression; and mTORC2 signaling that downregulates SOCS5 to enhance STAT6 activation. These pathways work in coordination, with STAT6 fine-tuning the STAT6-independent pathways.

  This study using Stat6 knockout mice demonstrated that STAT6-deficient mice were deficient in IL-4-mediated functions including Th2 helper T-cell differentiation, expression of cell surface markers, and immunoglobulin class switching to IgE. The findings confirmed that STAT6 is essential for mediating IL-4 responses and establishing Th2 immune responses.

  This study found that BCL-6-deficient mice develop TH2 inflammation and produce TH2 cytokines independent of a functional STAT6 gene, suggesting alternative pathways for Th2 development. The research demonstrated that while IL-4 and STAT6 play important roles in regulating TH2 responses in vivo and in vitro, other transcription factors besides STAT6 can contribute to TH2 cytokine production.

  This comprehensive review details the IL-4 receptor signaling mechanisms. The IL-4 receptor complex consists of the IL-4R alpha chain and the common gamma chain (gamma c), resulting in activation of multiple signaling pathways including JAK/STAT, IRS-1/2, and PI3K pathways. The review emphasizes STAT6 as the key mediator of IL-4-induced gene expression and Th2 cell differentiation.

  This study demonstrated that introducing GATA-3 into Stat6-deficient T cells completely restored Th2 development, inducing c-Maf and Th2-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in the IL-4 locus. This finding established GATA-3 as a master regulator that can drive Th2 development independently of STAT6, highlighting the complex regulatory network controlling Th2 differentiation.

  This research identified Grail as a key regulator that controls Th2 responses by targeting Stat6 transcription factor for degradation in activated Th2 cells. The study shows that Grail acts as a negative feedback mechanism to regulate STAT6 activity and maintain proper Th2 cell homeostasis, providing insight into the post-translational regulation of STAT6 in Th2 development.

  This study revealed that STAT3 works with STAT6 to promote Th2 cell differentiation. While STAT6 is required for Th2 cell development, STAT3 also plays a crucial role in this process. The expression of Th2-specific transcription factors such as Gata3, Maf, Batf, and Irf4 that are regulated by STAT6 was reduced in the absence of STAT3, indicating cooperative regulation between STAT3 and STAT6 in Th2 differentiation.

  This review discusses the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes and their signaling mechanisms. In T-cells, IL-4 induces the differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells into Th2 cells through STAT6 activation. In B cells, IL-4 drives immunoglobulin class switching. The article provides insights into how these cytokines fine-tune immune responses through their receptor complexes and downstream signaling pathways.

  This review discusses non-canonical pathways of IL-4 and IL-13 in CD4+ T cells. Although it is clear that STAT6 plays an important role in Th2 differentiation, many publications have identified STAT6-independent mechanisms. The article explores the differential expression patterns and functional consequences of IL-4 versus IL-13 in type-2 immunity, highlighting the complexity of Th2 cytokine signaling.

  This recent study compared the ability of IL-4 and IL-13 to promote M2 polarization and ROS generation in human primary macrophages. The research demonstrates that both cytokines activate STAT6 phosphorylation and induce equivalent expression of traditional M2 markers, highlighting the conserved role of STAT6 signaling across different immune cell types in response to IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation.
