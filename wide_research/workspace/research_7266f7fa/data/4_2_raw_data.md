  This study reports the identification of a STAT6 gain-of-function (GOF) variant in a patient exhibiting early-onset multiple allergic diseases. STAT6 plays a critical role in IL-4 and IL-13 signaling and regulates key features of the Th2 immune response, such as IgE production, mast cell activation, and eosinophil recruitment. The discovery of this GOF variant provides new insights into the genetic basis of severe allergic disorders and represents a significant breakthrough in understanding STAT6-mediated immunopathology.

  KT-621, a first-in-class oral STAT6 degrader, demonstrates complete STAT6 degradation in blood and skin following low daily oral doses. In Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers, the drug showed robust STAT6 degradation with a favorable safety profile. Preclinical data indicate that KT-621 blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling with potency 20-fold greater than Dupilumab in human cells. This represents a paradigm shift in targeting previously "undruggable" transcription factors and offers potential as an oral alternative to biologic injections for Th2-driven inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis and asthma.

title: "NAB2-STAT6 drives an EGR1-dependent neuroendocrine program"
authors: ["CM Hill"]
year: 2025
journal: "eLife"
doi: "10.7554/eLife.98072"

content: |
  This study demonstrates that the NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein operates as a transcriptional coactivator for enhancers and promoters normally targeted by the EGR1 transcription factor. The STAT6 moiety of the fusion protein is a major driver of its nuclear localization and contributes to NAB2's co-activating abilities. This research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of NAB2-STAT6 fusion-driven tumors and represents a significant advance in understanding STAT6's role in oncogenesis.
