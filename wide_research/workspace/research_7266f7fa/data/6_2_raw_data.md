  STAT6 was found to be an adverse prognosis factor in AML patients, especially those who only received chemotherapy treatments. Patients that only received chemotherapy in high STAT6 group showed significantly lower overall survival (OS). STAT6 expression was increased in AML patients and serves as a prognostic biomarker.
