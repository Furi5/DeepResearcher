  This comprehensive review details the specific mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 regulate key skin barrier proteins through STAT6 signaling in atopic dermatitis. IL-4 and IL-13 bind to their shared receptor complex (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1) on keratinocytes, activating JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 kinases which phosphorylate and activate STAT6. Activated STAT6 translocates to the nucleus and directly downregulates loricrin (LOR) and involucrin (IVL) expression. For filaggrin (FLG), IL-4/IL-13 inhibit the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1 transcription factor, which is essential for FLG and LOR expression. Additionally, IL-4/IL-13-mediated STAT6 activation upregulates periostin, which stimulates IL-24 production, subsequently activating JAK/STAT3 pathway to inhibit FLG expression. These mechanisms collectively demonstrate how the IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 axis directly impairs skin barrier function in AD.

  This review focuses specifically on IL-13's role in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis through STAT6 signaling. IL-13 activation of STAT6 pathway reduces expression of key epidermal barrier proteins including filaggrin (FLG), loricrin, involucrin, hornerin, desmoglein, desmocollin, keratin 1 and keratin 10. STAT6 signaling also disrupts skin lipid composition by reducing ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol levels. IL-13 inhibits filaggrin expression by interfering with the OVOL1 signaling pathway and activates the periostin-IL-24 axis through STAT6 activation, which further down-regulates filaggrin expression via STAT3 activation. These findings highlight the central role of IL-13-STAT6 signaling in skin barrier dysfunction in AD.

  This article provides detailed mechanisms of IL-4/IL-13 STAT6 signaling in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-4 signals through Type II IL-4 receptor (shared with IL-13) on non-hematopoietic cells like keratinocytes, triggering phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 kinases. Activated JAKs phosphorylate and activate STAT6 transcription factor, which dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates IL-4-responsive genes. The IL-4/IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT6 pathway directly downregulates filaggrin (FLG) expression, a key protein essential for skin barrier integrity. This pathway also increases production of epithelial-derived cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in keratinocytes, amplifying Th2 immune response and inflammation. JAK1 is involved in AD pathogenesis through signaling pathways of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-22, TSLP, and IFN-γ.

  This review discusses the pathogenic and therapeutic implications of the IL-13/IL-4‒JAK‒STAT6/STAT3 axis in atopic dermatitis. The article emphasizes the competition between the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) axis and the IL-13/IL-4‒JAK‒STAT6/STAT3 axis in regulating skin barrier function. The IL-4/IL-13-JAK-STAT6 axis directly contributes to skin barrier dysfunction by suppressing critical barrier proteins and promoting pro-inflammatory environment. The review highlights how this signaling axis drives disease progression through both inflammatory mechanisms and direct barrier impairment.

  This comprehensive review discusses the central role of IL-4 and IL-13 as main drivers of the Th2 immune axis in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. In AD skin, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier impairment through their signaling pathways. Intracellular signaling activated by IL-4 is mediated by a complex interaction of STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6, with STAT6 mediating responses to both IL-4 and IL-13. The review emphasizes how these cytokines activate the JAK1/JAK2-STAT6/STAT3 pathway, which inhibits expression of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and downregulates filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL).

  This foundational review establishes the role of Th2 cytokines including IL-4 and IL-13 in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. Dendritic cells trigger Th2 polarization and secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31, and IL-10. The Th2 cytokines have both unique and overlapping functions in AD. IL-4 and IL-13 are particularly important for driving the inflammatory response and contributing to skin barrier dysfunction through their signaling pathways. This article provides the basic framework for understanding how IL-4 and IL-13 function in the context of Th2-mediated inflammation in AD.

  This review focuses on the IL-4/IL-13 axis and its therapeutic targeting in atopic dermatitis. Th2 cells stimulate production of several inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 and IL-19) involved in recruitment of inflammatory cells and skin barrier dysfunction. The article discusses how IL-4 and IL-13 signal through shared receptors and activate common downstream pathways including JAK-STAT signaling. The therapeutic implications of blocking this axis highlight its central role in AD pathogenesis, particularly in driving both inflammation and barrier impairment.

  This review discusses normal skin barrier function and pathogenesis of skin barrier defects in atopic dermatitis. The article highlights how type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), directly impair barrier function by suppressing expression of filaggrin (FLG) and other epidermal differentiation complex proteins. The IL-4/IL-13 signaling through JAK-STAT pathways contributes to the vicious cycle of inflammation and barrier dysfunction in AD. This comprehensive review connects the molecular mechanisms of cytokine signaling with clinical manifestations of skin barrier impairment in AD.
