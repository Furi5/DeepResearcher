  STAT6 is a transcription factor with several key domains where gain-of-function variants have been identified: DNA-binding domain (p.E382, p.D419), linker domain (p.D519), SH2 domain (p.K595), and proximal to phosphorylation site (p.P643 near p.Y641). These variants decrease electro-negativity of the protein, enhancing STAT6's binding to DNA. The GOF variants lead to hyperactive STAT6 signaling through increased and sustained phosphorylation, enhanced transcriptional activity, TH2 skewing with increased production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 cytokines, and upregulation of key receptors like IL-4Rα and CD23. This creates a positive feedback loop amplifying allergic signaling in atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases.

  Human STAT6 protein has conserved domain organization: N-terminal domain (NTD), coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), linker domain, SH2 domain, and transactivation domain (TAD). STAT6 requires phosphorylation at Y641 for dimerization via reciprocal SH2 domain interactions. The STAT6 dimer recognizes DNA sequence 5′-TTCN₃/₄GAA-3′ with strong preference for N4 over N3 sites. Key DNA-binding residues include K284, K288, K367, K370, K379, Q418 that form hydrogen bonds with DNA backbone, and unique residue H415 that forms specific hydrogen bond with guanine base. STAT6 undergoes dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding with larger dimer interface angle enabling N4 site preference. The structure provides mechanistic understanding of STAT6's transcriptional activation function.

  STAT6 contributes to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis through JAK-STAT signaling pathway by: (1) Activation by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 - IL-4 binds to type I IL-4R, stimulating phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, which activate and phosphorylate STAT6. Phosphorylated STAT6 dimerizes, translocates to nucleus, and acts as transcription factor binding to IL-4-responsive genes driving Th2 immune response. (2) Promotion of skin barrier dysfunction - IL-4 and IL-13 binding to type II IL-4 receptor activates JAK1 and TYK2, leading to phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6, resulting in downregulation of filaggrin (FLG) expression and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in keratinocytes, amplifying inflammatory cycle.

  All STAT6 analogs carry a modified C-terminus, which comprises the key phosphorylation site (Tyr641) responsible for homodimerization via reciprocal SH2 domain interactions. Upon phosphorylation at Tyr641, STAT6 undergoes dimerization and translocates to the nucleus where it initiates transcription of target genes. This study demonstrates the critical role of Tyr641 phosphorylation in STAT6 activation and nuclear translocation.

  The domain organization of STAT6 is comprised of several functional regions: an N-terminal coiled coil domain, a DNA binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain. The SH2 domain is essential for STAT binding to phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of activated cytokine receptors and for STAT dimerization. The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the DNA-binding domain recognizes specific DNA sequences. The transactivation domain is responsible for recruiting transcriptional machinery after nuclear translocation.

  The SH2 domain of the STAT family of transcription factors is essential for STAT binding to phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of activated cytokine receptors. In STAT6, the SH2 domain mediates reciprocal interactions between phosphorylated tyrosine residues (particularly Tyr641) to form active homodimers. Mutations in the SH2 domain can disrupt proper dimerization and nuclear translocation, highlighting its critical role in STAT6 signaling pathway activation.

  Upon IL-4 binding, Stat6 is rapidly activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr641 in the cytoplasm. Site-specific phosphorylation of Stat6 activates reciprocal SH2 domain-mediated dimerization. The phosphorylated STAT6 homodimerizes through SH2 domain–pY peptide interactions and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences and initiates transcription of target genes involved in allergic inflammation and immune responses.

  Cytokine receptor engagement triggers phosphorylation of Janus kinases (JAKs) leading to STAT phosphorylation, which requires tight negative regulation. Gain-of-function variants in STAT6 disrupt this regulation, leading to sustained activation and pathological signaling. These variants are implicated in severe allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis, demonstrating the critical role of proper STAT6 regulation in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing allergic inflammation.
