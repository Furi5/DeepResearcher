  The JAK-STAT signaling pathway plays a central role in modulating multiple immune axes involved in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. STAT6 is primarily activated by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 through two receptor complexes: Type I IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα + γc chain) activates JAK1/JAK3, while Type II IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα + IL-13Rα1) activates JAK1/TYK2, both leading to STAT6 phosphorylation. Activated STAT6 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and acts as transcription factor for IL-4-responsive genes. This signaling downregulates filaggrin (FLG) expression, impairs skin barrier function, and increases production of epithelial-derived cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) that amplify Th2 immune response. The critical role of STAT6 pathway has led to development of targeted therapies including dupilumab (IL-4Rα blocker) and JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, baricitinib) that disrupt this pathway.

  IL-13 is a crucial cytokine involved in AD pathogenesis, working in concert with IL-4 through shared STAT6 signaling pathways. Both cytokines signal through Type II IL-4 receptor complex (IL-4Rα + IL-13Rα1), activating JAK1/TYK2 kinases that phosphorylate STAT6. This STAT6 activation drives Th2 immune responses and contributes to key AD features including skin barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and pruritus. IL-13 specifically promotes atopic inflammation via IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 signaling while simultaneously triggering negative feedback through decoy receptors.

  This study demonstrates distinct STAT activation patterns in AD, with STAT6 showing predominant activation in skin lesions reflecting local Th2 cytokine environment. The dichotomous activation of STAT5 and STAT6 in T cells highlights the cytokine shifts between systemic circulation and local skin microenvironment in AD patients. STAT6 activation correlates with disease severity and Th2 cytokine production in lesional skin.

authors: ["I Takeuchi", "K Mizuno", "M Moriyama"]

content: |
  Germline STAT6 gain-of-function variants cause severe allergic dysregulation characterized by early-onset severe atopic dermatitis, food allergies, eosinophilia, and elevated IgE levels. The D419H STAT6 mutation leads to overactivity of IL-4/JAK/STAT signaling pathway, with cells showing higher baseline STAT6 protein levels and increased phosphorylated STAT6 following IL-4 stimulation. This hyperactive signaling results in upregulated downstream STAT6 target genes involved in Th2 immune responses. Clinical manifestations include severe widespread eczema appearing in first month of life, multiple food allergies with anaphylaxis, eosinophilic asthma, and increased risk of follicular lymphoma.

  This study evaluated the association of IL-4, IL-13, and STAT6 expression with atopic disease development. STAT6 is activated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate the pathogenesis of allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis. The IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling axis represents a core pathway driving Th2-polarized immune responses in atopic conditions.

  Immune-mediated mechanisms contribute to skin barrier alterations in AD through cytokines that signal via JAK-STAT pathway, particularly IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22. The JAK-STAT pathway, with STAT6 as a key downstream effector, mediates multiple immune axes involved in AD pathogenesis. Targeting this pathway with JAK inhibitors represents a promising therapeutic approach for moderate-to-severe AD.

  IL-4 and IL-13 are considered the main drivers of Th2 immune axis and key cytokines for AD pathogenesis. In murine models, these cytokines demonstrate critical roles in disease development. The STAT6 signaling pathway serves as the principal intracellular mediator for IL-4 and IL-13 effects, making it a central therapeutic target in AD management.

  IL-4 and IL-13 are the signature cytokines of type 2 inflammatory response in AD, produced by Th2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. These cytokines signal through shared receptors activating STAT6 transcription factor, which drives Th2 polarization and contributes to skin barrier dysfunction. The IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 axis represents a fundamental pathway in AD pathogenesis that bridges innate and adaptive immune responses.

  From an immunological perspective, AD is predominantly influenced by the Th2 pathway (IL-4 and IL-13), while also involving varying degrees of Th1, Th17, and Th22 responses. The STAT6 signaling pathway serves as the intracellular mediator for Th2 cytokine effects, regulating gene expression that contributes to inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and pruritus in AD.

  STAT6 is primarily stimulated by IL-4 and IL-13, and acts as a Th2-inducing transcriptional activator. It regulates T cell differentiation by controlling key transcription factor GATA3 expression. STAT6 is implicated in the pathophysiology of various allergic conditions including atopic dermatitis, asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and food allergies. As a core component of Th2 immune response, STAT6 signaling represents a fundamental pathway in allergic disease pathogenesis.
