  This comprehensive review details the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 regulate skin barrier proteins through STAT6 signaling. Key findings include: IL-4 and IL-13 share the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 receptor on keratinocytes, activating JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 kinases that phosphorylate STAT6. Activated STAT6 directly inhibits expression of filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL). Additionally, IL-4/IL-13 inhibit cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1, a transcription factor that promotes FLG and LOR expression. IL-4/IL-13 also activate DUOX1, generating reactive oxygen species that inhibit PTPN1, leading to enhanced STAT6 phosphorylation. STAT6 transgenic mice show significantly decreased LOR and IVL expression compared to wild-type controls.

  This seminal study demonstrates that Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) down-regulate loricrin and involucrin expression through STAT6-dependent mechanisms. In primary human keratinocytes, IL-4 and IL-13 significantly decreased loricrin and involucrin gene expression. Skin biopsies from STAT6 transgenic mice exhibited significantly lower levels of both loricrin and involucrin compared to wild-type controls. The findings establish that Th2 cytokines inhibit expression of these critical skin barrier proteins via STAT6 signaling, providing a mechanistic link between immune dysregulation and skin barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis.

  This study investigated the role of STAT6 in cutaneous permeability barrier function. STAT6-deficient mice exhibited superior skin barrier function compared to wild-type mice, with decreased transepidermal water loss, lower stratum corneum pH, and increased stratum corneum hydration. The enhanced barrier function in STAT6-deficient mice suggests that STAT6 signaling negatively impacts skin barrier integrity. The findings support the concept that blocking STAT6 signaling may be a strategy to enhance skin barrier function in conditions like atopic dermatitis.

  This study examined how cytokines modulate filaggrin expression in atopic dermatitis. The research demonstrated that Th2 cytokines, particularly IL-4 and IL-13, significantly down-regulate filaggrin expression in human keratinocytes. The study provides evidence for the direct role of immune cytokines in regulating key skin barrier proteins, establishing a mechanistic link between immune dysregulation and the characteristic skin barrier defects observed in atopic dermatitis.

  This study elucidates the molecular mechanism by which IL-4 downregulates involucrin expression. The research demonstrates that IL-4-activated STAT6 sequesters the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), preventing it from binding to the involucrin promoter. This sequestration mechanism represents a novel pathway through which STAT6 signaling inhibits the expression of skin barrier proteins, providing additional insight into how Th2 cytokines disrupt epidermal differentiation in atopic dermatitis.

  This study investigated the molecular mechanism of IL-4 suppression of loricrin transcription. Using a loricrin-firefly luciferase construct, the researchers demonstrated that STAT6 is involved in IL-4-mediated downregulation of loricrin expression in keratinocytes. The findings provide specific molecular evidence for STAT6's role in suppressing loricrin transcription, further establishing the connection between Th2 cytokine signaling and impaired skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis.

  This study using STAT6 transgenic mice demonstrated that constitutive STAT6 activation in keratinocytes leads to skin barrier defects. The transgenic mice exhibited decreased expression of loricrin and involucrin, mimicking the skin barrier abnormalities seen in human atopic dermatitis. The research provides in vivo evidence that STAT6 signaling directly contributes to skin barrier dysfunction by suppressing the expression of key epidermal differentiation proteins.

  This study revealed a novel amplification mechanism for STAT6 signaling in keratinocytes. IL-4 and IL-13 activate dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1), generating reactive oxygen species that inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1). The inhibition of PTPN1 leads to enhanced and prolonged STAT6 phosphorylation, thereby amplifying the downstream inhibitory signals on skin barrier protein expression. This mechanism provides insight into how Th2 cytokines can persistently suppress filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin expression in atopic dermatitis.
