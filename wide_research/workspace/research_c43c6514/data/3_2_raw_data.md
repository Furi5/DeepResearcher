  The JAK-STAT pathway plays a central role in pruritus mechanisms in atopic dermatitis. STAT6 is activated by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 through receptors that activate JAK1 and TYK2, contributing to skin barrier dysfunction and inflammation underlying itch. IL-31, a key pruritogen, signals through JAK1 and JAK2 to activate STAT3 and STAT5, directly driving itch sensation. IL-31 promotes elongation of sensory nerves in the skin and directly communicates with primary cutaneous afferent neurons. In the spinal cord, STAT3 activation mediates astrogliosis in the spinal dorsal horn, acting as an amplifier of itch signals and leading to chronic pruritus. The JAK-STAT pathway transduces signals from key pruritogenic cytokines like IL-31 and contributes to inflammation and nerve changes that perpetuate the "itch-scratch cycle."

  STAT6 is a key transcription factor activated by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in AD pathogenesis. STAT6's role in itch signaling is primarily indirect through regulation of skin barrier integrity and immune environment. IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through STAT6 downregulates critical skin barrier proteins including filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin. A compromised skin barrier allows increased penetration of external agents that activate immune cells and sensory nerves, leading to pruritus. While STAT6 does not directly regulate classic neuropeptides, it is part of the signaling network for key pruritogenic pathways. IL-31, known as the "itch cytokine," is produced by activated T cells, and the intracellular signaling activated by IL-4 involves complex interactions of STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6. The OX40-OX40L interaction, which induces Th2 cytokines including IL-31, is also regulated by this pathway.

  Cytokines central to AD, particularly IL-4 and IL-13, signal through the JAK/STAT pathway involving STAT6. IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through all members of the JAK family and STAT6 homodimers decreases expression of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. These cytokines directly activate and sensitize sensory neurons, forming key neuroimmune cross-talk that drives pruritus. Activated sensory neurons release neuropeptides including substance P and CGRP. Substance P is increased in AD and can induce production of other cytokines, activating mast cells via the MrgprX2 receptor. The protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), upregulated in AD and inducing itch, mediates effects through release of substance P and CGRP, leading to neurogenic inflammation. STAT6 signaling contributes to the inflammatory milieu that sensitizes sensory neurons, which then release neuropeptides that amplify inflammation and perpetuate itch sensation.

  Genetic studies have identified STAT6 as a key gene associated with atopic dermatitis susceptibility. The STAT6 gene increases viral replication in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients. STAT6 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of developing severe atopic dermatitis phenotypes. This study provides evidence for the genetic basis of STAT6 involvement in AD pathogenesis and its role in modulating immune responses in the skin environment.

  A germline STAT6 gain-of-function variant results in spontaneous activation of the STAT6 signaling pathway and is associated with an early-onset and severe atopic dermatitis phenotype. The genetic and functional data obtained provide evidence that constitutive STAT6 overactivity contributes to the development of a severe allergic phenotype. This study demonstrates the direct causal relationship between STAT6 hyperactivity and AD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of STAT6 signaling in disease severity and progression.

  Dysregulation of neuroimmune circuits plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, causing inflammation, pruritus, pain, and barrier dysfunction. IL-4 and IL-13 use the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway regulating inflammation, skin barrier function, and itch in AD. Novel findings identified TSLP as a primary pruritogen that can directly activate neurons, pointing to a complex epidermal-neuronal communication network. The study emphasizes the bidirectional communication between immune cells and sensory neurons in AD pruritus pathogenesis.

  IL-4 and IL-13 promote neurogenic itch, which is the hallmark of AD, via two non-histaminergic pathways: directly by activating sensory neurons and indirectly by inducing other pruritogens. These cytokines signal through receptors that activate JAK1 and TYK2, leading to phosphorylation and activation of STAT6. The IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 axis plays a crucial role in both the inflammatory and pruritic components of AD. Targeting this axis with biologic therapies has shown significant efficacy in reducing pruritus in AD patients, demonstrating the central role of STAT6-mediated signaling in itch pathogenesis.

  Emerging research describes neuronal effector functions on skin immune cells in mouse models of atopic and contact dermatitis. The review explores how sensory neurons communicate with immune cells through neuropeptide release and cytokine signaling. STAT6 activation by IL-4 and IL-13 creates a pro-inflammatory environment that sensitizes neurons and promotes neuropeptide release. This bidirectional communication forms a feed-forward loop that amplifies both inflammation and pruritus in AD. The neuroimmune axis represents a critical therapeutic target for breaking the itch-scratch cycle in atopic dermatitis.
