  The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a key pathway in AD. Specifically, the binding of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to their receptor (IL-4R) activates and phosphorylates JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn activates STAT6. IL-4 and IL-13 are pivotal Th2 cytokines in AD. The activation of STAT6 by these cytokines promotes the release of inflammatory factors, recruits eosinophils and mast cells, contributes to itching (pruritus), and impairs skin barrier function by inhibiting antimicrobial peptides. This process is fundamental to the chronic inflammation seen in AD. Tissue Resident Memory T Cells (TRM) are present in both lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients and are a key driver of persistent, recurrent inflammation. These TRM cells can secrete various cytokines, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-γ. TRM cells in AD are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, which activate the STAT6 signaling pathway. The activation of STAT6 is a critical mechanism that drives the chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and symptoms characteristic of atopic dermatitis.

  STAT6 is critical for the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 (Th2) cells. It is activated by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. STAT6 regulates the expression of Gata3, a master transcription factor that drives and maintains Th2 cell development and function. STAT6 is a central mediator of chronic allergic inflammation, which is a type of T cell-dependent inflammation. It orchestrates immune responses by activating cytokine gene expression and signaling in both immune cells and tissue cells (like airway and esophageal epithelial cells and keratinocytes). In atopic dermatitis, STAT6 down-regulates skin barrier proteins (e.g., filaggrin), impairing the epidermal barrier. STAT6 is essential for the development of several chronic allergic diseases, which are forms of chronic inflammation including asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis.

  A specific STAT6 gain-of-function (GOF) mutation (c.1255G > C, p.D419H) causes severe atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. The study found no significant difference in the overall frequency of memory T cell populations or in the specific subsets of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells within the CD4+ memory T cell compartment. However, there was a key functional change: CD4+ T cells (including memory T cells) from the patient produced more IL-4 per cell (higher Mean Fluorescence Intensity), despite the percentage of IL-4-producing cells being normal. There was also increased transcriptional activity in patient CD4+ T cells, with higher baseline and IL-4-induced mRNA levels of STAT6 target genes like XBP1, EPAS1, and BCL6, which are involved in Th2 cell differentiation and proliferation. The STAT6 GOF mutation drives chronic inflammation through a hyperactive IL-4/JAK/STAT signaling pathway with enhanced signaling, increased cytokine production, and constitutive nuclear localization of STAT6. The inflammation is primarily driven by increased total STAT6 protein levels, which leads to more pSTAT6 upon IL-4 stimulation.

  IL-13 is a crucial immunoregulatory cytokine that drives chronic inflammation and tissue changes in atopic dermatitis. It is primarily produced by Th2 cells and Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) in the skin. Increased IL-13 expression leads to the recruitment of eosinophils and activated T cells, resulting in an amplification of the skin's inflammatory response, driving the pathway of chronic inflammation in AD. IL-13, along with IL-4, plays a key role in impairing the skin barrier by downregulating the expression of critical structural proteins like filaggrin (FLG), loricrin, and involucrin. STAT6 is the primary signaling molecule activated by IL-13 (and IL-4) and is central to executing its pro-inflammatory and tissue-remodeling effects. The activation of STAT6 by IL-13 directly reduces the expression of skin barrier proteins like filaggrin, hornerin, and loricrin. The IL-13/STAT6 axis also contributes to inflammation by upregulating other mediators. For example, STAT6 activation induces keratinocytes to produce periostin, which in turn stimulates the production of IL-24, further downregulating filaggrin.

  STAT6 is a key transcription factor in Th2 cell differentiation and function. It is activated by IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. STAT6 regulates the expression of GATA3, the master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation. In the context of chronic inflammation in atopic dermatitis, STAT6-mediated signaling promotes the persistence of Th2 cells and their cytokine production, contributing to the maintenance of chronic inflammation. The STAT6 pathway is essential for the development of allergic inflammation and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases including atopic dermatitis.

  Recurrent, skin-limited disease implicates skin-resident memory T cells in both inflammatory skin diseases and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In chronic inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, tissue-resident memory T cells play a crucial role in disease persistence and recurrence. These long-lived T cells remain in the skin and can rapidly respond to local stimuli, contributing to the chronic inflammatory microenvironment. The persistence of tissue-resident memory T cells in the skin provides a cellular basis for the chronic nature of inflammatory skin diseases and their tendency to recur in previously affected areas.

  STAT6 is essential for Th2 cell differentiation and function in allergic inflammation. It regulates the expression of key Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. In chronic inflammatory conditions like atopic dermatitis, persistent STAT6 activation contributes to the maintenance of Th2-mediated inflammation. STAT6 signaling promotes the survival and persistence of memory Th2 cells, which are critical for the chronicity of allergic diseases. The continuous activation of STAT6 in tissue-resident memory T cells may contribute to the persistent inflammation characteristic of chronic atopic dermatitis.

  Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) play critical roles in chronic inflammatory diseases. In the context of atopic dermatitis, TRM cells persist in the skin and contribute to disease chronicity through their ability to rapidly produce inflammatory cytokines upon reactivation. The differentiation and maintenance of TRM cells are regulated by various signaling pathways, including cytokine signaling. In chronic inflammatory skin diseases, TRM cells can maintain local inflammation and contribute to disease recurrence, representing a key cellular component in the pathogenesis of persistent inflammatory conditions like atopic dermatitis.
