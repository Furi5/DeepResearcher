  STAT6 is a critical signaling molecule for the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which are central to the T helper 2 (Th2) immune response in atopic dermatitis. IL-4 and IL-13 play a key role in isotype switching to IgE synthesis and act via STAT6. In AD, STAT6 activation by IL-4 and IL-13 leads to inhibition of innate immune response genes, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), creating a skin environment permissive to viral replication. A hyperactive STAT6 pathway increases the risk of severe viral skin infections in AD patients. Genetic variations in the STAT6 gene are associated with increased propensity for AD patients to have a history of eczema herpeticum.

  STAT6 is activated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate the pathogenesis of allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis. Once phosphorylated, STAT6 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of GATA3, the master regulator transcription factor for Th2 cells. GATA3 reconstitutes Th2 development in STAT6-deficient T cells. STAT6 collaborates with co-factors like PARP14, which acts as a transcriptional switch for STAT6. PARP14's enzymatic activity is required for optimal Th2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). The active STAT6 dimer binds directly to specific DNA sequences in promoters of Th2-associated genes, leading to their transcription.

  STAT6 mediates responses that lead to Th2 and Th9 differentiation and IgE class switching on B cells. Genetic variants of STAT6 have been linked to allergic diseases, including AD and increased IgE levels. In AD skin, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier impairment by reducing expression of terminal differentiation proteins like filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (INV) through STAT6. STAT6 is a crucial intracellular signaling molecule activated by key Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, directly driving differentiation of pathogenic Th2 and Th9 cells, and mediating the damaging effects of Th2 cytokines on the skin barrier.

title: "STAT6-dependent and -independent mechanisms in Th2 polarization"

  The primary STAT6-dependent mechanism is the IL-4/STAT6 signaling cascade where IL-4 binding triggers STAT6 phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation. STAT6 promotes expression of the Th2 master regulator GATA3, which drives expression of classic Th2 cytokines. STAT6 is crucial for both initiating and maintaining the Th2 phenotype and orchestrates epigenetic changes favoring Th2 gene expression. STAT6-independent mechanisms include: Notch signaling (directly promotes IL4 and GATA3 expression), mTORC2 signaling (downregulates SOCS5 to potentiate STAT6 signaling), IL-2/STAT5 pathway (induces IL-4 expression in GATA3-independent manner), and Wnt signaling (TCF-1 stimulates GATA3-1b and IL-4 production). These pathways work in coordinated manner for optimal Th2 development.

  Study confirms STAT6 gain of function (GOF) as a novel monogenetic cause of early onset atopic disease. STAT6 GOF mutations lead to severe atopic manifestations including atopic dermatitis, demonstrating the critical role of STAT6 signaling pathway in allergic disease pathogenesis.

  Transgenic mice expressing active Stat6 (Stat6VT) in T cells have increased Th2 differentiation in vivo and in vitro. All mice developed severe atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation, demonstrating that constitutive STAT6 activation in T cells is sufficient to drive Th2 polarization and AD pathogenesis.

  The STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 reduces the risk of asthma in mice with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis by blocking the STAT6 signaling pathway. This demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting STAT6 in atopic diseases and confirms the central role of STAT6 in the Th2-mediated inflammatory cascade connecting AD and asthma.

  Retrovirus-mediated introduction of Stat6:ER into developing Th1 cells induced Th2-specific cytokines and suppressed IFNγ production in a 4-HT-dependent manner. Stat6 is critical for IL-4-mediated Th2 cell development. Gene targeting studies have revealed that Stat6 is critical for Th2 cell development as well as the induction of GATA-3. This study demonstrates that activated STAT6 alone is sufficient to reprogram T cell differentiation toward the Th2 lineage.

  Stat6-deficient T lymphocytes fail to differentiate into Th2 cells in response to either IL-4 or IL-13. These results demonstrate that, despite the existence of multiple signaling pathways activated by IL-4 and IL-13, STAT6 is essential for mediating responses to these cytokines and for the development of Th2 cells. STAT6 is required for both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in T cells.

  STAT6-mediated displacement of polycomb by trithorax complex establishes long-term maintenance of GATA3 expression in T helper type 2 cells. This mechanism explains how STAT6 signaling not only initiates GATA3 expression but also establishes stable epigenetic programming that maintains Th2 cell identity and function over time, providing insight into the persistence of Th2 responses in chronic allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis.
