  KT-621 demonstrated robust STAT6 degradation in Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial. Achieved >90% mean STAT6 degradation in blood at all single and multiple doses above 1.5 mg, with complete STAT6 degradation in both blood and skin at doses of 50 mg and above. Biomarker results showed median TARC reduction of up to 37% and median Eotaxin-3 reduction of up to 63% at Day 14, comparable or superior to published data for dupilumab. The drug was well-tolerated with safety profile undifferentiated from placebo, no serious adverse events, and no treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than one subject. Phase 1b trial in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patients ongoing with results expected Q4 2025.

title: "STAT6 gain-of-function disease: p.D519N is a new disease-causing variant that responds well to dupilumab treatment"
authors: ["Simran Samra", "et al."]
year: 2024
journal: "Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global"
doi: "10.1016/j.jacig.2024.100095"

  Identified a novel STAT6 gain-of-function disease-causing variant p.D519N through functional experiments showing significantly elevated STAT6 phosphorylation. Patient treated with dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) showed significant improvement: reduction in food-induced anaphylaxis episodes (from multiple per year to only one episode related to cat exposure), decreased frequency of severe respiratory infections requiring hospitalization. However, patient still showed restrictive lung function defects and developed recurrent lip angioedema, requiring additional ruxolitinib treatment. Confirms dupilumab as effective treatment for STAT6 gain-of-function disease but suggests combination therapy may be needed for complete symptom control.

title: "An overview on the role of interleukin-13 in atopic dermatitis"
authors: ["M. Napolitano", "et al."]
year: 2023

content: |
  Comprehensive review detailing the role of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-13 binding to the functional heterodimeric IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 receptor results in activation of downstream tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and STAT6 signaling pathways. The review emphasizes the central role of STAT6 in mediating the biological effects of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines, which are key drivers of Th2 inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Provides mechanistic understanding of why STAT6 represents an attractive therapeutic target.

  Detailed review of JAK-STAT signaling in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-4 and IL-13 bind to type II IL-4R, inducing robust phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, followed by activation and phosphorylation of STAT6. The review highlights STAT6 as the major transcription factor mediating biological effects of IL-4 and IL-13, and its critical role in IgE production and allergic airway inflammation. Provides comprehensive understanding of STAT6's position in the inflammatory cascade of atopic dermatitis.

  Investigated the roles of Jak/STAT6 and AHR signaling pathways in IL-4/IL-13-mediated tight junction impairment. The study explored new mechanisms of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in skin barrier dysfunction, demonstrating that benvitimod can inhibit these effects through modulation of STAT6 signaling. This research provides insights into how STAT6 signaling contributes to skin barrier defects in atopic dermatitis beyond its role in immune cell activation.

  First demonstration of the impact of alterations in immune cell responses, including T and B-cells, downstream of dysregulated STAT6 signaling. The study showed for the first time how STAT6 dysregulation affects multiple immune cell types and contributes to atopic disease pathogenesis. This research provides mechanistic insights into how STAT6 gain-of-function variants lead to severe allergic phenotypes through broad effects on immune cell function.
