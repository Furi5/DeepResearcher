  JAK inhibitors work by blocking the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which is a crucial signaling cascade for many cytokines involved in AD inflammation. Key inflammatory cytokines in AD, such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and TSLP, use the JAK/STAT pathway for signal transduction. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 signal through receptors that activate JAK1 and JAK3 or JAK1 and TYK2, leading directly to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT6. STAT6 is a key regulator of the Th2 immune response, promoting T-helper 2 cell differentiation by upregulating GATA3 and contributing to B-cell class switching to produce IgE. JAK inhibitors prevent the activation of STAT6 by blocking the upstream JAKs that IL-4 and IL-13 rely on, thereby disrupting the Th2 immune response central to AD pathogenesis.

  Upadacitinib is an oral, selective, and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that more potently inhibits JAK1 than other JAK isoforms (JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2). It functions as an ATP-competitive inhibitor, competing with ATP to bind to JAK enzymes and blocking their kinase activity. By inhibiting JAK enzyme activity, upadacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of downstream STAT proteins. Specifically, it reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibits cytokine-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5. The prevention of STAT phosphorylation inhibits the formation of STAT dimers, preventing their translocation into the cell nucleus to bind DNA and promote transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. This action blocks the signaling of key cytokines involved in the immune dysregulation and inflammation characteristic of atopic dermatitis.

  Baricitinib is an oral small molecule JAK inhibitor that primarily inhibits JAK1 and JAK2. By inhibiting these enzymes, it blocks the phosphorylation and activation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT), a key step in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. In AD, cytokine disorders cause abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to disease development. Baricitinib directly counteracts this abnormal activation. The inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway in CD4+ T cells leads to suppression of other key inflammatory pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. By blocking this network of signaling pathways, baricitinib reduces the activation of CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells and the secretion of their inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-21, and IL-22), ultimately improving symptoms of moderate and severe atopic dermatitis.

  Abrocitinib is a selective and reversible Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor that specifically targets the JAK1 enzyme, a key component of the intracellular JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This pathway is activated by various cytokines (like IL-4, IL-13, IL-31) that are overexpressed in atopic dermatitis and drive inflammation and skin barrier dysfunction. Abrocitinib works by blocking the ATP-binding site on the JAK1 enzyme, preventing JAK1 from using ATP to phosphorylate itself and its partner JAKs when a cytokine binds to its receptor. By inhibiting JAK1 phosphorylation, abrocitinib disrupts the entire JAK-STAT signaling cascade, preventing the subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT proteins. Consequently, STAT proteins cannot form dimers and translocate to the cell nucleus to regulate gene transcription, leading to a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that contribute to atopic dermatitis symptoms.

  The IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis plays a critical role in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-13 and IL-4 activate JAK1-STAT6 signaling, and JAK1 inhibitors reduce pruritus by targeting this pathway. Activation of the IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis inhibits the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor mediated up-regulation of filaggrin, loricrin, and other skin barrier proteins. This mechanism explains how JAK inhibitors can improve skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis by blocking the inhibitory effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on barrier protein expression through STAT6 signaling.

  The JAK-STAT pathway is involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines driving cutaneous inflammation in atopic dermatitis. This comprehensive review discusses the role of JAK-STAT pathways in AD pathogenesis and explores updated applications of JAK inhibitors in treating AD. The pathway constitutes a rapid membrane-to-nucleus signaling module that induces expression of various critical mediators of inflammation. Targeting this pathway with JAK inhibitors attenuates cytokine signals and shows clinical efficacy through suppression of various immune pathways associated with AD, including Th2, Th22, and Th17 responses.

  The JAK-STAT pathway is involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines driving cutaneous inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Janus kinase inhibitors provide a novel therapeutic approach by targeting this central signaling pathway. These inhibitors block the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins, thereby preventing the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. The review summarizes clinical data on various JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib, baricitinib, and abrocitinib, highlighting their efficacy in reducing AD symptoms through modulation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade.

  This review discusses current knowledge about the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and, specifically, the role of JAK1 in the pathology and treatment of atopic dermatitis. JAK1 plays a central role in mediating signals from key cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and TSLP. The selective inhibition of JAK1 by drugs like upadacitinib and abrocitinib provides targeted therapy for AD while potentially minimizing side effects associated with broader JAK inhibition. The review emphasizes the importance of JAK1 in STAT6 activation downstream of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling.
