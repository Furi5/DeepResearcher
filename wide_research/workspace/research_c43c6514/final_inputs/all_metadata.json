Both cytokines signal through Type II IL-4 receptor complex (IL-4Rα + IL-13Rα1), activating JAK1/TYK2 kinases that phosphorylate STAT6. This STAT6 activation drives Th2 immune responses and contributes to key AD features including skin barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and pruritus. IL-13 specifically promotes atopic inflammation via IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 signaling while simultaneously triggering negative feedback through decoy receptors."

    "content": "The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a key pathway in AD. Specifically, the binding of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to their receptor (IL-4R) activates and phosphorylates JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn activates STAT6. IL-4 and IL-13 are pivotal Th2 cytokines in AD. The activation of STAT6 by these cytokines promotes the release of inflammatory factors, recruits eosinophils and mast cells, contributes to itching (pruritus), and impairs skin barrier function by inhibiting antimicrobial peptides. This process is fundamental to the chronic inflammation seen in AD. Tissue Resident Memory T Cells (TRM) are present in both lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients and are a key driver of persistent, recurrent inflammation. These TRM cells can secrete various cytokines, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-γ. TRM cells in AD are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, which activate the STAT6 signaling pathway. The activation of STAT6 is a critical mechanism that drives the chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and symptoms characteristic of atopic dermatitis."

Activated STAT6 directly inhibits expression of filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL). Additionally, IL-4/IL-13 inhibit cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1, a transcription factor that promotes FLG and LOR expression. IL-4/IL-13 also activate DUOX1, generating reactive oxygen species that inhibit PTPN1, leading to enhanced STAT6 phosphorylation. STAT6 transgenic mice show significantly decreased LOR and IVL expression compared to wild-type controls."

STAT6 is activated by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 through receptors that activate JAK1 and TYK2, contributing to skin barrier dysfunction and inflammation underlying itch. IL-31, a key pruritogen, signals through JAK1 and JAK2 to activate STAT3 and STAT5, directly driving itch sensation. IL-31 promotes elongation of sensory nerves in the skin and directly communicates with primary cutaneous afferent neurons. In the spinal cord, STAT3 activation mediates astrogliosis in the spinal dorsal horn, acting as an amplifier of itch signals and leading to chronic pruritus. The JAK-STAT pathway transduces signals from key pruritogenic cytokines like IL-31 and contributes to inflammation and nerve changes that perpetuate the \"itch-scratch cycle.\""

    "content": "This review focuses on the IL-4/IL-13 axis and its therapeutic targeting in atopic dermatitis. Th2 cells stimulate production of several inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 and IL-19) involved in recruitment of inflammatory cells and skin barrier dysfunction. The article discusses how IL-4 and IL-13 signal through shared receptors and activate common downstream pathways including JAK-STAT signaling. The therapeutic implications of blocking this axis highlight its central role in AD pathogenesis, particularly in driving both inflammation and barrier impairment."

The article highlights how type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), directly impair barrier function by suppressing expression of filaggrin (FLG) and other epidermal differentiation complex proteins. The IL-4/IL-13 signaling through JAK-STAT pathways contributes to the vicious cycle of inflammation and barrier dysfunction in AD. This comprehensive review connects the molecular mechanisms of cytokine signaling with clinical manifestations of skin barrier impairment in AD."

These variants decrease electro-negativity of the protein, enhancing STAT6's binding to DNA. The GOF variants lead to hyperactive STAT6 signaling through increased and sustained phosphorylation, enhanced transcriptional activity, TH2 skewing with increased production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 cytokines, and upregulation of key receptors like IL-4Rα and CD23. This creates a positive feedback loop amplifying allergic signaling in atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases."

Key DNA-binding residues include K284, K288, K367, K370, K379, Q418 that form hydrogen bonds with DNA backbone, and unique residue H415 that forms specific hydrogen bond with guanine base. STAT6 undergoes dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding with larger dimer interface angle enabling N4 site preference.

Key inflammatory cytokines in AD, such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and TSLP, use the JAK/STAT pathway for signal transduction. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 signal through receptors that activate JAK1 and JAK3 or JAK1 and TYK2, leading directly to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT6. STAT6 is a key regulator of the Th2 immune response, promoting T-helper 2 cell differentiation by upregulating GATA3 and contributing to B-cell class switching to produce IgE. JAK inhibitors prevent the activation of STAT6 by blocking the upstream JAKs that IL-4 and IL-13 rely on, thereby disrupting the Th2 immune response central to AD pathogenesis."

    "content": "Upadacitinib is an oral, selective, and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that more potently inhibits JAK1 than other JAK isoforms (JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2). It functions as an ATP-competitive inhibitor, competing with ATP to bind to JAK enzymes and blocking their kinase activity. By inhibiting JAK enzyme activity, upadacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of downstream STAT proteins. Specifically, it reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibits cytokine-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5. The prevention of STAT phosphorylation inhibits the formation of STAT dimers, preventing their translocation into the cell nucleus to bind DNA and promote transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. This action blocks the signaling of key cytokines involved in the immune dysregulation and inflammation characteristic of atopic dermatitis."

By inhibiting these enzymes, it blocks the phosphorylation and activation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT), a key step in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. In AD, cytokine disorders cause abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to disease development. Baricitinib directly counteracts this abnormal activation. The inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway in CD4+ T cells leads to suppression of other key inflammatory pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. By blocking this network of signaling pathways, baricitinib reduces the activation of CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells and the secretion of their inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-21, and IL-22), ultimately improving symptoms of moderate and severe atopic dermatitis."

This pathway is activated by various cytokines (like IL-4, IL-13, IL-31) that are overexpressed in atopic dermatitis and drive inflammation and skin barrier dysfunction. Abrocitinib works by blocking the ATP-binding site on the JAK1 enzyme, preventing JAK1 from using ATP to phosphorylate itself and its partner JAKs when a cytokine binds to its receptor. By inhibiting JAK1 phosphorylation, abrocitinib disrupts the entire JAK-STAT signaling cascade, preventing the subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT proteins. Consequently, STAT proteins cannot form dimers and translocate to the cell nucleus to regulate gene transcription, leading to a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that contribute to atopic dermatitis symptoms."

STAT6 is a central mediator of chronic allergic inflammation, which is a type of T cell-dependent inflammation.

In atopic dermatitis, STAT6 down-regulates skin barrier proteins (e.g., filaggrin), impairing the epidermal barrier.

The study found no significant difference in the overall frequency of memory T cell populations or in the specific subsets of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells within the CD4+ memory T cell compartment. However, there was a key functional change: CD4+ T cells (including memory T cells) from the patient produced more IL-4 per cell (higher Mean Fluorescence Intensity), despite the percentage of IL-4-producing cells being normal. There was also increased transcriptional activity in patient CD4+ T cells, with higher baseline and IL-4-induced mRNA levels of STAT6 target genes like XBP1, EPAS1, and BCL6, which are involved in Th2 cell differentiation and proliferation. The STAT6 GOF mutation drives chronic inflammation through a hyperactive IL-4/JAK/STAT signaling pathway with enhanced signaling, increased cytokine production, and constitutive nuclear localization of STAT6. The inflammation is primarily driven by increased total STAT6 protein levels, which leads to more pSTAT6 upon IL-4 stimulation."

A compromised skin barrier allows increased penetration of external agents that activate immune cells and sensory nerves, leading to pruritus.

IL-31, known as the \"itch cytokine,\" is produced by activated T cells, and the intracellular signaling activated by IL-4 involves complex interactions of STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6.

    "content": "Cytokines central to AD, particularly IL-4 and IL-13, signal through the JAK/STAT pathway involving STAT6. IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through all members of the JAK family and STAT6 homodimers decreases expression of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. These cytokines directly activate and sensitize sensory neurons, forming key neuroimmune cross-talk that drives pruritus. Activated sensory neurons release neuropeptides including substance P and CGRP. Substance P is increased in AD and can induce production of other cytokines, activating mast cells via the MrgprX2 receptor. The protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), upregulated in AD and inducing itch, mediates effects through release of substance P and CGRP, leading to neurogenic inflammation. STAT6 signaling contributes to the inflammatory milieu that sensitizes sensory neurons, which then release neuropeptides that amplify inflammation and perpetuate itch sensation."

Novel findings identified TSLP as a primary pruritogen that can directly activate neurons, pointing to a complex epidermal-neuronal communication network. The study emphasizes the bidirectional communication between immune cells and sensory neurons in AD pruritus pathogenesis."

By binding to IL-4Rα with high affinity, dupilumab blocks both IL-4 and the IL-13/IL-13Rα1 complex from binding to their respective receptors, preventing the initiation of downstream signaling. In vitro assays using HEK293/STAT6/Luciferase cells demonstrated that dupilumab potently inhibits both IL-4-induced and IL-13-induced STAT6 signaling. This blockade directly inhibits the downstream JAK-STAT6 signaling pathway, which is central to the gene expression that drives type 2 inflammation in atopic dermatitis."

Through specific IL-13 neutralization, tralokinumab treatment improves the transcriptomic profile of lesional skin as early as week 4, significantly reducing Th2 pathway-related genes (including IL31, CCL17, CCL26) and serum biomarkers (CCL17/TARC, periostin, IgE). The treatment also enhances epidermal differentiation proteins and barrier genes (loricrin, CLDN1) while reducing epidermal thickness. Although the article does not directly report STAT6 pathway data, IL-13's classical signaling pathway involves activation through IL-13 receptor leading to STAT6 phosphorylation, suggesting that tralokinumab's IL-13 neutralization indirectly inhibits STAT6 signaling."

This binding prevents IL-13 from engaging the functional signaling receptor complex IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1, thereby inhibiting downstream STAT6 signaling. The unique epitope specificity enables an additional clearance mechanism where the antibody-cytokine complex binds to IL-13Rα2, gets internalized by cells, and is transported to lysosomes for degradation.
