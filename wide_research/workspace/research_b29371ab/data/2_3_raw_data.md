  This comprehensive review examines the neuroimmune mechanisms underlying chronic itch in atopic dermatitis (AD). Key findings include:
  - Chronic itch in AD results from orchestrated interactions between histamine-independent C fibres in the skin, keratinocytes and immune cells
  - IL-31 is a key immune cell-derived cytokine that directly promotes itch by binding to IL-31 receptor on itch-sensory neurons
  - Histamine-dependent pathways do not contribute substantially to chronic itch in AD, which is primarily mediated by non-histaminergic pathways
  - Sensory nerves are classified as either histamine-responsive (histaminergic) or non-responsive (non-histaminergic)
  - IL-31 activates pruritoceptors that often co-express TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels
  - Clinical importance is underscored by the effectiveness of nemolizumab (anti-IL-31RA antibody) in reducing itch

  This review discusses dysregulation of neuroimmune circuits in AD pathophysiology:
  - Dysregulation of neuroimmune circuits plays a key role in AD, causing inflammation, pruritus, pain, and barrier dysfunction
  - Itch mediators comprise different molecular family members including amines (histamine, serotonin), proteases, cytokines (IL-31, IL-4, IL-13)
  - Intradermal IL-31 administration produces delayed itch response in humans and prompts itch in mice
  - Neuronal sensitization for histamine-induced itch occurs in lesional skin of AD patients
  - Sensory neurons co-opt classical immune signaling pathways to mediate chronic itch

  Comprehensive analysis of molecular and cellular mechanisms in AD:
  - Pathophysiology involves complex neuroimmune interactions where cytokines activate/sensitize sensory neurons
  - Key cytokines: IL-4 & IL-13 (activate sensory neurons via IL-4Rα), IL-31 (pruritogenic cytokine activating IL-31R on neurons), TSLP (activates neurons via TSLPR through TRPA1), IL-33 (alarmin stimulating pruritogenic cytokines)
  - JAK/STAT pathway is central therapeutic target for cytokine receptors (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, TSLP)
  - TRP ion channels (TRPA1, TRPV1) crucial for transmitting itch signals downstream of cytokine receptors
  - PAR-2 activation by proteases contributes to neurogenic inflammation and itch
  - Mrgprs mediate itch in response to non-histaminergic pruritogens
