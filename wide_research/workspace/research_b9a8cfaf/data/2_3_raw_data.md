  This comprehensive review details the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of STAT6. In the context of atopic dermatitis, STAT6 regulates genes of the epidermal differentiation complex in keratinocytes, including loricrin and involucrin. Mice expressing constitutively active STAT6 develop a disease mimicking human atopic dermatitis. STAT6 activation by IL-4 and IL-13 leads to dimerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to specific DNA sequences (TTC(N)2-4 GAA). At target gene promoters, STAT6 assembles a transcriptional enhanceosome complex including co-activators CBP/p300 and NCoA-1, chromatin remodeling complexes like BRG1, and bridging factors p100 and RNA helicase A to initiate transcription.

  This review comprehensively examines how IL-4 and IL-13 regulate skin barrier proteins through STAT6 signaling in atopic dermatitis. IL-4 and IL-13 bind to the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 receptor complex on keratinocytes, activating JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which phosphorylate and activate STAT6. Activated STAT6 downregulates the expression of filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL) - key components of the epidermal barrier. Evidence from Stat6 transgenic mice shows significantly decreased Lor and Ivl expression, while Stat6-deficient mice show improved barrier function and increased Flg and Ivl expression. The IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 pathway also inhibits nuclear translocation of OVOL1 transcription factor, further impairing FLG and LOR expression. Therapeutic blockade of IL-4/IL-13 signaling with dupilumab restores FLG and LOR levels in AD patients.

title: "IL-4 induces expression of TARC/CCL17 via two STAT6 binding sites that are essential for promoter activation"

  This study demonstrates that IL-4 induces TARC/CCL17 expression in human T cells through STAT6-dependent mechanisms. Two specific STAT6 binding sites (GAS motifs with consensus sequence TTC(N4)GAA) were identified in the CCL17 promoter at positions -177 to -187 (motif A) and -213 to -223 (motif B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed STAT6 binding to these sites in vivo. Both sites are functional and necessary for full promoter activation - mutating either site reduces IL-4-induced activation, while mutating both completely abrogates the response. This STAT6-mediated CCL17 expression creates a feedback loop for recruiting CCR4+ Th2 cells to inflammatory sites in atopic dermatitis.

  This study provides the first report describing CCL26 regulation in human keratinocytes. IL-4 and IL-13 significantly enhance CCL26 production in HaCaT keratinocytes through STAT6-dependent signaling pathways. The production of CCL26, a key eosinophil chemoattractant, is regulated by Th2 cytokines in keratinocytes, contributing to eosinophil recruitment in atopic dermatitis lesions. This mechanism represents an important link between keratinocyte-derived chemokines and eosinophilic inflammation in AD pathogenesis.

  This study confirms that IL-4 signals through the Jak1,2/Stat6 pathway in keratinocytes to stimulate CCL26 expression. The STAT6-dependent regulation of CCL26 provides a mechanistic explanation for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, linking Th2 cytokine signaling to eosinophil recruitment through keratinocyte-derived chemokine production.

  This comprehensive review describes the orchestration of chemokine networks in atopic dermatitis. In AD skin lesions, expression of type 2 chemokines including CCL17, CCL22, and CCL26 is upregulated. CCL17 and CCL22 serve as chemoattractants for CCR4+ Th2 cells, while CCL26 (eotaxin-3) recruits eosinophils through CCR3. Serum levels of these chemokines reflect disease activity in AD patients, with CCL17, CCL22, and CCL26 serving as important biomarkers for disease severity and therapeutic response monitoring.

  This review discusses the competition between pro-inflammatory and barrier-protective signaling pathways in atopic dermatitis. The IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis upregulates type 2 chemokines (CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, CCL26) while downregulating skin barrier proteins. STAT6 activation by Th2 cytokines leads to suppression of epidermal differentiation complex genes and promotion of chemokine expression, creating a vicious cycle of inflammation and barrier dysfunction in AD pathogenesis.

  This genetic association study reveals that among the various target genes of STAT6 are the genes located in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). The study demonstrates an interactive effect between STAT6 and IL13 gene polymorphisms on eczema risk, with STAT6 augmenting the effect of IL13. This provides genetic evidence for the central role of STAT6 in regulating EDC genes and its contribution to atopic dermatitis susceptibility through gene-environment interactions.

  This landmark study identifies human germline gain-of-function STAT6 variants that cause severe allergic disease including atopic dermatitis. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is the main transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of IL-4, a key cytokine in allergic inflammation. The study demonstrates that STAT6 gain-of-function variants lead to enhanced transcriptional activity and increased expression of STAT6 target genes, providing direct human genetic evidence for the critical role of STAT6 in allergic disease pathogenesis including atopic dermatitis.

  This review comprehensively examines the molecular mechanisms of atopic dermatitis, highlighting the role of STAT6 in chemokine network regulation. B cells produce chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 under Th2 cytokine influence, attracting T cells to AD lesions. The STAT6-mediated chemokine network, including CCL17, CCL22, and CCL26, creates a self-amplifying inflammatory loop that perpetuates AD pathogenesis through continuous recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin.
