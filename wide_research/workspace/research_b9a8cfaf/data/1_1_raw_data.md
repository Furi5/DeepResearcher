  STAT6 serves as the principal downstream signaling molecule and transcription factor for both IL-4 and IL-13 in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. IL-4 binds to Type I IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα and common gamma chain), stimulating phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 which activate STAT6. Both IL-4 and IL-13 can bind to Type II IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1), inducing phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, leading to activation of STAT3 and STAT6. Once phosphorylated, STAT6 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, binding to IL-4-responsive genes and driving Th2 immune response. This activation leads to downregulation of filaggrin (FLG) expression, resulting in skin barrier dysfunction, and increases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in keratinocytes.

  STAT6 contributes to the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and loss of skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 signal through STAT6 pathway, directly downregulating expression of key epidermal barrier proteins including filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (INV). This weakening of skin barrier allows increased allergen penetration and transepidermal water loss. Overexpression of constitutively active STAT6 in T cells is sufficient to induce skin inflammation characteristic of AD. However, NC/Nga mice can still develop AD in absence of STAT6, suggesting other pathways can also contribute to pathology.

  STAT6 is identified as a key mediator in AD pathogenesis within the Th2 immune pathway. STAT6 activation by IL-4 and IL-13 directly contributes to skin barrier impairment by downregulating critical terminal differentiation proteins (filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin). STAT6 is essential for mediating intracellular signaling leading to Th2 and Th9 cell differentiation and IgE class switching in B cells. Genetic variants of STAT6 have been associated with allergic diseases including AD and elevated IgE levels. A significant research gap exists as there are no current clinical therapies directly targeting STAT6, highlighting potential area for future drug development. Current strategies focus on upstream targets (IL-4Rα with dupilumab) or broader pathway inhibitors (JAK inhibitors) that indirectly affect STAT6 signaling.

  The JAK-STAT pathway plays an essential role in the dysregulation of immune responses in AD, including the exaggeration of Th2 cell response. STAT6 is mainly involved in the transduction of IL-4 and IL-13 signals. IL-4 has a critical role in the pathogeny of atopic dermatitis through STAT6 activation. The pathway represents a promising therapeutic target for AD treatment.

  IL-4 and IL-13 utilize JAK-STAT signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory gene expression and the effector functions associated with disease pathology. STAT6 serves as the primary transcription factor activated by both cytokines. The signaling cascade involves receptor binding, JAK activation, STAT6 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and gene transcription. This pathway is central to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis.

  The JAK-STAT pathway plays a central role in the pathology and symptomology of AD. Many key cytokines involved in the pathology of AD signal through this pathway. STAT6 activation is particularly important for mediating the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on skin barrier function and Th2 inflammation. The pathway represents a validated therapeutic target with multiple JAK inhibitors showing efficacy in AD treatment.

  IL-4 and IL-13 play a key role in AD pathogenesis, orchestrating effector Th2 immune responses. In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with the skin barrier function and promotes inflammation. The cytokines mediate their effects through STAT6-dependent gene regulation, contributing to the characteristic features of AD including pruritus, barrier dysfunction, and chronic inflammation.

  Th2 cytokines exhibit a variety of inhibitory effects on permeability barrier function via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). Studies in STAT6-deficient mice demonstrate the critical role of this transcription factor in mediating the barrier-disrupting effects of IL-4 and IL-13, providing direct evidence for STAT6's involvement in skin barrier dysfunction in AD.
