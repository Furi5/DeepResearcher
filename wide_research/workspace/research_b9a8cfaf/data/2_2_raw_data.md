  This comprehensive review details the specific mechanisms of STAT6 activation in atopic dermatitis. The process begins with IL-4 binding to type I IL-4 receptor, which stimulates phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate STAT6 on tyrosine residues. Once phosphorylated, STAT6 dimerizes through SH2 domain interactions. The phosphorylated STAT6 dimer subsequently translocates into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences of IL-4-responsive genes. IL-13 can also activate STAT6 through the type II IL-4 receptor involving JAK1 and TYK2. This IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling pathway contributes to skin barrier dysfunction by downregulating filaggrin expression and promotes production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TSLP.

  This review provides detailed molecular mechanisms of STAT6 activation in allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis. STAT6 activation is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 binding to their receptors. IL-4 binds to type I IL-4 receptor (common γ chain and IL4Rα) or type II receptor (IL4Rα and IL13Rα1). Receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of associated JAK kinases (Jak1 and Jak3), which phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues (Y575, Y603, Y631) on IL4Rα chain. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for STAT6 monomers via their SH2 domains. STAT6 is then phosphorylated by JAK kinases, leading to dimerization through SH2 domain interactions. The phosphorylated STAT6 dimer translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences (TTCN4GAA), where it cooperates with co-activators like CBP/p300, NCoAs, and PARP14 to initiate transcription of genes involved in allergic inflammation.

  This study describes a STAT6 gain-of-function mutation (E372K) that provides insights into STAT6 activation mechanisms. The E372K mutation results in hyper-phosphorylation of STAT6 both at baseline and following IL-4 stimulation compared to wild-type STAT6. The mutation does not affect dephosphorylation kinetics, indicating enhanced initial phosphorylation by JAK kinases. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the phosphorylated STAT6 E372K mutant showed enhanced nuclear translocation, with a modest increase in nuclear localization at baseline and markedly increased progressive translocation into the nucleus following IL-4 stimulation compared to wild-type protein. This hyperactive STAT6 signaling leads to severe allergic dysregulation including atopic dermatitis.

  This foundational study demonstrates that IL-4 binding to its receptor results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 by IL-4R-associated JAK kinases. The phosphorylation occurs on specific tyrosine residues that are critical for STAT6 activation and subsequent dimerization. The study provides mechanistic insights into the initial steps of STAT6 activation that are relevant to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.

  This review highlights the essential role of JAK-STAT pathway in dysregulation of immune responses in atopic dermatitis, including exaggeration of Th2 cell response. The article discusses how STAT6 activation through IL-4 and IL-13 signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by promoting Th2 differentiation and cytokine production. The review also touches upon regulatory mechanisms that control STAT6 activity in the context of chronic skin inflammation.

  This comprehensive review discusses the role of STAT6 in atopic dermatitis, noting that STAT6 mediates responses leading to Th2 and Th9 differentiation and IgE class switching on B cells. In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with the translocation of the transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits OVOL1-mediated skin barrier gene expression. The review also mentions that genetic variants of STAT6 have been associated with AD susceptibility, highlighting the importance of STAT6 signaling in disease pathogenesis.

  This study confirms STAT6 gain of function as a novel monogenetic cause of early onset atopic disease. The research provides additional evidence for the critical role of STAT6 signaling in allergic inflammation and demonstrates how dysregulated STAT6 activation can lead to severe atopic manifestations including dermatitis. The findings support the central role of STAT6 phosphorylation and activation in Th2-mediated immune responses.

  This study examines the regulation of STAT6 dephosphorylation, providing insights into the negative feedback mechanisms that control STAT6 signaling. The research demonstrates that IL-4 engagement of the receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-1 and Jak-3, which subsequently phosphorylate the IL-4Rα chain itself. Understanding the dephosphorylation mechanisms is crucial for comprehending the full cycle of STAT6 activation and inactivation in atopic dermatitis.
