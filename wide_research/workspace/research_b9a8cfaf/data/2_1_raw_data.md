  This study reports the first crystal structures of the phosphorylated STAT6 core fragment (CF) homodimer in both DNA-free form and in complex with N4 or N3 site DNA. The overall architecture of STAT6 CF consists of distinct modules: N-terminal coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), linker domain, SH2 domain, and C-terminal phosphotyrosine tail. A key finding is that STAT6 undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding, with protomers rotating to adopt a more compact architecture. Residue H415 in the DBD is identified as critical for DNA recognition, forming a hydrogen bond with guanine base and determining STAT6's preference for N4 site DNA over N3. The dimer interface angle is larger in STAT6 compared to STAT1 and STAT3, contributing to its DNA recognition specificity. Dimerization is mediated by the SH2 domain interacting with phosphorylated tyrosine Y641 tail segment. STAT6 has a shorter C-terminal loop in its SH2 domain compared to STAT1 and STAT3, resulting in a more open and flexible dimeric structure that is more accessible for DNA binding.

  This study identifies heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT6 as a cause of a new, severe primary atopic disorder. Sixteen patients from 10 families presented with early-onset, multi-system allergic disease including severe treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, elevated serum IgE, hypereosinophilia, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, asthma, IgE-mediated food allergies, and anaphylaxis. The GOF variants are located in different domains of STAT6: DNA-binding domain (p.E382, p.D419), linker domain (p.D519), and SH2 domain (p.K595). Structural modeling revealed that most variants lie near the protein-DNA interface, with amino acid changes resulting in decreased electro-negativity at the DNA-binding interface, predicted to enhance STAT6's binding to DNA. The variants lead to sustained STAT6 phosphorylation, increased STAT6 target gene expression, TH2 immune skewing, and slower STAT6 dephosphorylation kinetics after IL-4 stimulation. Precision treatment with anti-IL-4Rα antibody (dupilumab) and JAK inhibitors was highly effective.

  This review details the structural domains of STAT6 and their specific functions in IL-4 signaling. The N-terminal coiled-coil domain facilitates protein-protein interactions. The DNA-binding domain allows STAT6 to bind specific DNA sequences (consensus TTC(N)2-4 GAA) in the nucleus. The SH2 domain is critical for activation, allowing cytoplasmic STAT6 to dock onto phosphorylated IL-4 receptor and positioning it for phosphorylation by receptor-associated Janus Kinases on tyrosine-641. The C-terminal transactivation domain is responsible for transcription activation function, containing regions that recruit transcriptional coactivators such as CBP/p300 and NCoA-1, which are essential for initiating gene transcription.

  This study elucidates the role of STAT6 in IL-13/IL-4 signaling and skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis. In keratinocytes, IL-13 and IL-4 bind to their receptor complex (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1), activating downstream JAK enzymes (JAK1/TYK2/JAK2) which phosphorylate and activate STAT6 (and STAT3). The activated IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis directly inhibits expression of critical skin barrier proteins including filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL). This axis also prevents cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of the transcription factor OVOL1, which is essential for up-regulating FLG and LOR. The skin barrier is regulated by competition between the IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis (which impairs barrier) and the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) axis (which strengthens barrier). Excessive STAT6 activation tilts this balance toward barrier dysfunction.

  This comprehensive review details the role of JAK-STAT signaling in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-4 and IL-13 bind to type II IL-4 receptor, inducing robust phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, followed by activation and phosphorylation of STAT6. Clinically, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier defects, cutaneous infections, inflammation, skin thickening, and itchiness. The STAT6 pathway is central to the type 2 immune response characteristic of atopic dermatitis, driving IgE production, eosinophil recruitment, and epithelial barrier dysfunction. The review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway with JAK inhibitors and biologics.

  This review highlights the crucial role of interleukin-13 in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-13 is a key cytokine involved in AD pathogenesis, working through the JAK-STAT6 signaling pathway. IL-13, along with IL-4, activates STAT6 which interferes with the translocation of transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits OVOL1-mediated upregulation of filaggrin and loricrin, leading to skin barrier impairment. The STAT6 activation by IL-13 contributes to the characteristic features of AD including chronic inflammation, pruritus, and barrier dysfunction.

  This study analyzes STAT6 expression in atopic dermatitis patients with different allergen sensitization patterns. STAT6, the signaling molecule from JAK/STAT pathway activated by IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines, plays an important role in IgE production and allergic airway inflammation. The research demonstrates altered STAT6 expression patterns in AD patients depending on their specific allergen sensitization profiles, highlighting the central role of STAT6 in mediating the immune responses characteristic of atopic dermatitis.

  This review discusses the central role of STAT6 in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and treatment. In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with the translocation of transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits OVOL1-mediated upregulation of filaggrin and loricrin expression. In AD skin, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier impairment through STAT6 activation. The review emphasizes how understanding STAT6 signaling has led to targeted therapies including dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα) that block STAT6 activation, representing a paradigm shift in AD treatment.
