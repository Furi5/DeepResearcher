  In a DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model, the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy. Treatment significantly reduced the total dermatitis severity score from 16.2 ± 1.38 in untreated AD mice to 9.2 ± 1.73 in treated mice. Histopathological analysis showed AS1517499 alleviated AD-like changes including hyperkeratosis, hypertrophy of the spinous layer, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (mast cells and eosinophils) in the dermis. The inhibitor reduced Th2-related factors (decreased GATA3 expression and IL-33 levels) and promoted regulatory T-cell responses (increased Foxp3 expression and IL-10 levels). Clinical signs related to barrier function such as dryness, exfoliation, and erosion were significantly improved, suggesting positive effects on skin barrier integrity.

  NX-3911, an oral STAT6 degrader, demonstrated rapid, potent, and selective degradation of STAT6 in blood and skin tissues in preclinical studies, resulting in complete suppression of IL-4/IL-13-driven signaling pathways. It showed therapeutic efficacy in animal models of atopic dermatitis as well as asthma and other type 2-mediated diseases. KT-621, another oral STAT6 degrader, achieved over 90% STAT6 degradation in blood at doses above 1.5 mg, with complete degradation in blood and skin observed at doses exceeding 50 mg in early clinical trials. Both degraders target the key IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway through STAT6 degradation.

  The IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis directly inhibits expression of critical barrier proteins including filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL). STAT6 activation inhibits the AHR-mediated upregulation of barrier proteins and blocks cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1. STAT6 induces keratinocytes to produce periostin, which upregulates IL-24 that inhibits FLG expression via STAT3 activation. The axis also activates DUOX1, leading to ROS production that sustains STAT6 signaling. STAT6 inhibitors restore barrier function by removing suppression on the AHR axis, allowing restoration of FLG, LOR, and IVL expression, reactivating the OVOL1 pathway, reducing periostin production, and breaking the oxidative stress feedforward loop.

  Benvitimod was found to inhibit IL-4- and IL-13-induced tight junction impairment in human keratinocytes by activating the AHR/ARNT pathway and inhibiting STAT6 phosphorylation. The study demonstrated that expression of tight junction proteins CLDN1, CLDN4, and OCLN was decreased in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients. Benvitimod treatment restored tight junction protein expression and improved barrier function through dual mechanisms of AHR activation and STAT6 inhibition.

  Comprehensive review of currently available preclinical models for atopic dermatitis therapeutic evaluation. Multiple mouse models including MC903-induced, DNCB-induced, and oxazolone-induced AD models show mixed immune responses and develop skin lesions beginning with itching, erythema, deep tissue erosion, and barrier dysfunction. These models are valuable for evaluating STAT6 inhibitors and other targeted therapies, providing insights into selection of suitable models based on specific therapeutic mechanisms and endpoints.

  KT-621, a potent, selective, oral STAT6 degrader, demonstrated comparable or superior activity to dupilumab in preclinical models. The data demonstrate the potential of KT-621 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases with best-in-pathway potential. Complete degradation of STAT6 was observed in both blood and skin tissues at higher doses, a key target in atopic dermatitis.

  The reversible, non-degrading STAT6 inhibitor caused a significant, dose-dependent reduction of airway inflammation in preclinical asthma models. While focused on asthma, the mechanism of STAT6 inhibition is relevant to atopic dermatitis as both conditions share common Th2-driven inflammatory pathways involving IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through STAT6.

  Study demonstrates that STAT6 is a promising therapeutic target for atopic dermatitis itch. Findings showed model-dependent inhibition of itch-like behaviors by targeting STAT6. The inactivation of STAT6 is beneficial to AD treatment in terms of itch relief and attenuating cutaneous inflammation, highlighting STAT6 as a key target for addressing the pruritus component of atopic dermatitis.
