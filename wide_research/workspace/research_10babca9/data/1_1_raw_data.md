  Th2 cytokines, particularly IL-4 and IL-13, play a critical role in causing skin barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis. These cytokines downregulate the production of key epidermal barrier proteins through a STAT6-dependent mechanism. Specifically, the expression of barrier proteins loricrin and involucrin is down-regulated by Th2 cytokines through STAT-6. Additionally, Th2 cytokines reduce levels of essential skin lipids (long-chain free fatty acids and ceramides) in a STAT6-dependent manner. This represents a central mechanism linking Th2 immune activation to the barrier dysfunction that characterizes AD.

  The JAK-STAT pathway is the primary signaling mechanism for numerous cytokines implicated in AD, including Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31. STAT6 is a key transcription factor that mediates intracellular signaling for the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. The activation of STAT6 is essential for the differentiation and function of Th2 cells. In the skin, IL-4 and IL-13, signaling through STAT6, actively contribute to the impairment of the skin barrier by downregulating the expression of critical terminal differentiation proteins in keratinocytes, such as filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (INV).

  STAT6 is a key transcription factor that mediates intracellular signaling for the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with the translocation of the transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits the OVOL1-mediated induction of terminal differentiation genes. Genetic variants of the STAT6 gene have been associated with an increased risk of allergic diseases, including AD and elevated IgE levels. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) system can inhibit this IL-4/IL-13-mediated STAT6 activation, thereby helping to restore the expression of skin barrier proteins.

  The STAT6 gene increases viral replication in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients with a history of eczema herpeticum. Genetic association studies have identified STAT6 polymorphisms that are associated with increased susceptibility to atopic dermatitis and related allergic conditions.

  The disruption of the STAT6 gene in mice has revealed its requirement for the development of Th2 cells and Th2-specific immune responses, such as IgE production. STAT6-deficient mice show impaired Th2 immune responses and are protected from developing atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions, demonstrating the essential role of STAT6 in AD pathogenesis.

  Atopic dermatitis is a prevalent global health issue affecting approximately 10-20% of children and 2-10% of adults worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease consortium, at least 171 million individuals were affected with AD in 2019. The highest reported prevalence was 34% among Swedish children, while the lowest was 0.65% among Tunisian children. There is a consistent pattern of higher disease burden in younger age groups. AD has a lifetime prevalence of well over 20% in many affluent country settings with substantial variation across geographic regions and ethnic groups.

  This review focuses on the recent evidence of the role of Th2 cytokines in allergic skin disorders, especially AD, and introduces Th2 cytokine-targeting therapies. The IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling pathway plays a central role in the allergic response and IgE production in atopic dermatitis. Among Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), the IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling pathway is particularly important for driving the pathological features of AD.

  AD skin is characterized by a type 2 immune response, with Th2/Tc2 cells being major contributors to various pathological aspects of AD and associated comorbidities. The immune activation of the Th2 pathway is the hallmark of AD, with a strong Th2 tone being the basis of all AD phenotypes and endotypes. STAT6 signaling plays a crucial role in mediating this Th2-driven inflammation and barrier dysfunction.

  AD has a lifetime prevalence of well over 20% in many affluent country settings with substantial variation. AD affects up to 25% of the population in some regions. There are significant unmet medical needs in AD treatment, particularly for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who do not respond adequately to conventional therapies. The disease burden includes substantial impact on quality of life, work productivity, and healthcare costs, highlighting the need for more targeted therapies addressing the underlying pathophysiology.

  Type 2 immunity has evolved to protect against parasitic diseases and toxins, playing a role in the expulsion of parasites and larvae from inner tissues to the exterior. In allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis, this protective mechanism becomes dysregulated. STAT6 is a key transcription factor in type 2 immune responses, mediating the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 in driving allergic inflammation and barrier dysfunction characteristic of AD.
