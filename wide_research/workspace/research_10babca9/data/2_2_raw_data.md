  This comprehensive review details the mechanisms by which IL-4 and IL-13 regulate key skin barrier proteins through STAT6 signaling. IL-4/IL-13-mediated STAT6 activation directly downregulates loricrin (LOR) and involucrin (IVL) gene expression. Additionally, IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1, a transcription factor essential for promoting filaggrin (FLG) and LOR expression. The pathway also involves IL-13-induced periostin production via STAT6, which subsequently upregulates IL-24 expression, leading to FLG downregulation through STAT3 activation. Oxidative stress generated by dual oxidase protein 1 (DUOX1) activation enhances STAT6 phosphorylation by inhibiting protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1, amplifying the inhibitory effects on barrier protein expression.

  This review highlights the specific STAT6 target genes involved in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. The IL-13/IL-4–JAK–STAT6 axis directly down-regulates the expression of key skin barrier proteins: filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL). STAT6 activation also inhibits the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of OVOL1, a transcription factor crucial for up-regulating FLG and LOR expression. In terms of inflammation, STAT6 activation in keratinocytes leads to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33, which are key drivers of inflammation in atopic dermatitis.

  This study demonstrates that IL-4 regulates CCL26 expression in keratinocytes through the Jak1, Jak2/STAT6 signaling pathway. IL-4 enhances STAT6 phosphorylation and induces its nuclear translocation. Promoter deletion and mutation studies identified the proximal STAT binding site as the critical response element for IL-4 regulation of CCL26. IL-4-induced CCL26 upregulation was dose-dependently inhibited by Jak inhibitors. This mechanism provides an explanation for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, as CCL26 is an eosinophil chemokine whose upregulation may contribute to eosinophil infiltration in atopic dermatitis lesions.

  This study elucidates the role of STAT6 in the IL-13/periostin/IL-24 pathway contributing to epidermal barrier dysfunction. Keratinocytes are the main tissue-resident cells producing IL-24 upon IL-13 stimulation, and this process is periostin-dependent and mediated through STAT6. IL-24 significantly downregulates filaggrin expression through STAT3 signaling. In a mite-treated mouse model, wild-type mice showed enhanced IL-24 expression and STAT3 activation in the epidermis, which was absent in STAT6-deficient and periostin-deficient mice, confirming these events as downstream effects of STAT6 and periostin. The pathway represents: IL-13 → (via STAT6) → periostin → IL-24 → (via STAT3) → filaggrin downregulation → epidermal barrier dysfunction.

  This study identifies gain-of-function STAT6 variants as a novel monogenetic cause of early-onset atopic disease. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significantly increased transcript abundance of known STAT6 target genes, including IL4R. The study confirms STAT6 gain-of-function as a novel monogenetic cause of severe atopic disease, highlighting the critical role of STAT6 in activating cytokine gene expression and cytokine signaling in both immune cells and keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.

  This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of STAT6 inhibition in atopic dermatitis. The STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 was shown to reduce the risk of asthma in mice with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis by blocking the STAT6 signaling pathway. This provides evidence for the central role of STAT6 in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and suggests STAT6 as a promising therapeutic target.
