  This study provides the structural basis for DNA recognition by STAT6. The STAT6 core fragment homodimer undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding, with a larger dimer interface angle compared to other STATs. Key domains involved include the DNA-binding domain (DBD), coiled-coil domain, linker domain, and SH2 domain. Residue H415 in the DBD is critical for discriminating its preferred N4 site DNA from the N3 site, forming a specific hydrogen bond with the guanine in the GAA half-site. The SH2 domain is crucial for dimerization via reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions upon phosphorylation at Y641.

  This study demonstrates that both CBP and p300 cooperate with STAT6 for induction of STAT6-dependent transcription. This cooperation does not appear to be due to acetylation of STAT6. The interaction depends on the carboxyl-terminal region of STAT6, and deletion of this region interferes with STAT6-dependent transcription. Point mutations in this region also affect STAT6 transcriptional activity, suggesting this is a key motif that may drive transcription through functional cooperation with CBP/p300.

  This review discusses the role of STAT6 SH2 domain in JAK-STAT signaling. The SH2 domain is essential for STAT6 recruitment to specific phosphotyrosine residues on the IL-4Rα receptor chain. Once recruited, STAT6 is phosphorylated on Tyr641 by associated Janus kinases 1 and 3 (JAK1 and JAK3). After phosphorylation, the SH2 domain enables STAT6 dimerization via reciprocal SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. This study also explores the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the STAT6 SH2 domain as potential therapeutic agents.

  This comprehensive review details the role of STAT6 in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. STAT6 plays a central role in the Th2 immune response, activated by IL-4 and IL-13 through Type I and Type II IL-4 receptors, leading to phosphorylation by JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2. Phosphorylated STAT6 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to activate IL-4-responsive genes. This signaling results in downregulation of filaggrin expression, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33), promotion of inflammation, B cell activation, IgE class-switching, and eosinophil recruitment. JAK inhibitors target this pathway by blocking the JAK enzymes responsible for STAT6 activation.

  This review highlights STAT6 as an important factor regulating Th2 responses, implicated in allergic conditions including atopic dermatitis. The STAT6 pathway is activated by IL-4 and IL-13, leading to phosphorylation by JAK kinases and subsequent dimerization and nuclear translocation. STAT6 functions include regulation of Th2 cell differentiation, B cell activation, and IgE production. The review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of targeting STAT6 signaling in allergic diseases.

  This review provides structural insights into the JAK-STAT pathway, including STAT6 activation mechanisms. The SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine on specific cytokine receptors. After receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, cytosolic STATs are recruited and phosphorylated by JAK kinases. The review discusses how STAT6 polymorphisms are associated with elevated IgE levels and atopic dermatitis, and how understanding the structural basis of these interactions informs therapeutic development.

  This comprehensive review discusses current knowledge about the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and specifically the role of JAK1 in the pathology and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The review covers how JAK-STAT signaling contributes to AD lesion development, pruritus, and pain. It also discusses targeted therapies in AD, including JAK inhibitors that block STAT6 activation by inhibiting upstream JAK kinases, providing important insights into the structural interactions within this signaling pathway.
