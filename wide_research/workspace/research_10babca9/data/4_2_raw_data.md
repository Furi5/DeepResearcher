  Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers demonstrated robust STAT6 degradation in blood and skin following low daily oral dosing. Key findings include:
  - Blood STAT6 degradation: Over 90% degradation at all doses above 1.5 mg, with complete degradation (≥95%) at ≥50 mg doses
  - Skin STAT6 degradation: Complete degradation at all ≥50 mg doses in multiple ascending dose cohorts
  - Th2 biomarker reductions: TARC median reduction up to 37% (comparable or superior to dupilumab), eotaxin-3 median reduction up to 63% (superior to dupilumab)
  - Safety profile: No difference in safety compared to placebo, no serious adverse events or treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation
  - Phase 1b trial (BroADen) in atopic dermatitis patients ongoing, data expected Q4 2025

content: |
  REX-8756 is a potent and selective oral STAT6 inhibitor that demonstrates complete pathway inhibition and is well tolerated in preclinical studies. The program is advancing through preclinical research and development until the start of Phase 2 clinical trials under collaboration with Sanofi. Recludix is responsible for advancing STAT6 inhibitors from preclinical research through Phase 1, with Sanofi taking over for Phase 2 and beyond.

content: |
  NX-3911 is a potent, selective, orally administered degrader of STAT6 that shows robust efficacy in multiple preclinical models of atopic dermatitis. STAT6 is a key transcription factor within the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways which act as drivers of inflammation in allergic conditions. The program demonstrates promising preclinical profile advancing toward clinical development.
