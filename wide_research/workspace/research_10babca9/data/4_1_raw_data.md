  The STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD) induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). Treatment effectively reduced AD-like skin lesions including hemorrhagic erythema, scars, dryness, and edema. It also alleviated airway inflammation associated with AD progression to asthma, evidenced by decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The inhibitor reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and attenuated airway remodeling by suppressing subepithelial collagen deposition. Mechanistically, AS1517499 specifically blocked the STAT6 signaling pathway, reducing STAT6 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissues. It suppressed Th2 response by decreasing GATA3 expression while promoting Treg response by increasing Foxp3 expression and elevating serum IL-10 levels. The treatment also significantly lowered elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-33.

  REX-8756 is a first-in-class oral, reversible, and highly selective STAT6 small molecule inhibitor designed to bind selectively to the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain of STAT6. The compound demonstrates complete and durable STAT6 pathway inhibition without causing protein degradation. In preclinical studies, REX-8756 showed potent efficacy in multiple disease models including asthma, acute lung inflammation, and dermatitis models. It effectively disrupts IL-4/IL-13-stimulated inflammatory biomarker production. The inhibitor was well tolerated in preclinical studies and represents a more selective approach compared to JAK family inhibitors due to its downstream position in the disease pathway, potentially offering fewer side effects.

  KT-621 is a once-daily, oral STAT6 heterobifunctional degrader with dupilumab-like activity. In preclinical studies, KT-621 demonstrated exquisite selectivity for STAT6 over other STAT proteins and fully blocked IL-4/IL-13 function. In human iPSC-derived sensory neurons, it potently degraded STAT6 and inhibited IL-13-induced transcription of itch- and pain-related genes, suggesting potential to alleviate these symptoms in atopic dermatitis patients. In TH2 cell assays, it completely blocked IL-4/IL-13 function with picomolar potency, with activity comparable or superior to dupilumab. In the MC903-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model, oral KT-621 showed robust in vivo STAT6 degradation and significantly reduced total serum IgE, with effects comparable to dupilumab. The compound was well tolerated in preclinical studies at low daily oral doses.

  PM-43I is a phosphatase-stable, cell-permeable phosphopeptidomimetic prodrug that targets the SH2 domains of STAT6 (and STAT5). It completely inhibits IL-4-stimulated STAT6 phosphorylation at concentrations between 1-2 μM. In a murine model of allergic airway disease, PM-43I potently inhibits and reverses pre-existing disease with a minimum ED₅₀ of 0.25 μg/kg, showing a U-shaped dose-response curve with maximum efficacy at very low doses. The compound is a dual inhibitor of STAT5 and STAT6, with binding affinity for STAT6 (IC₅₀ = 1.8 μM) slightly higher than for STAT5B (IC₅₀ = 3.8 μM) and significantly higher than for STAT3 (IC₅₀ = 29.9 μM). Its mechanism involves blocking the docking of STAT6 to the IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) and preventing phosphorylation of Tyr641 in STAT6, thereby inhibiting STAT6 activation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and subsequent pro-allergic gene expression.

  NX-3911 is a potent, selective, orally administered degrader of STAT6 that shows rapid and complete STAT6 degradation. In multiple preclinical models of atopic dermatitis, NX-3911 demonstrated robust efficacy with anti-inflammatory effects equivalent to STAT6 genetic knockout in animal models. The compound represents a promising therapeutic approach for targeting the STAT6 pathway in allergic and inflammatory diseases.

  Recludix has identified highly potent STAT6 SH2 domain inhibitors that demonstrate excellent selectivity across a broad panel of kinases and other proteins. These inhibitors show complete pathway inhibition through selective targeting of the STAT6 SH2 domain, providing a more specific approach compared to upstream pathway inhibitors. The compounds exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic properties and have shown efficacy in preclinical models of inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis.

  This review discusses the approach of targeting the SH2 domain of STAT6 with small molecule peptidomimetics to block recruitment to IL-4Rα, thereby preventing subsequent STAT6 activation. The strategy focuses on developing selective inhibitors that can specifically disrupt the STAT6 signaling pathway without affecting other STAT family members. The review covers the structural basis for STAT6 SH2 domain inhibition and the progress in developing small molecule inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity profiles for therapeutic applications in allergic and inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis.
