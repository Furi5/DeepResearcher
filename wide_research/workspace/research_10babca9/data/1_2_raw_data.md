  This study demonstrates that the STAT6 gene increases viral replication in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients, particularly those with a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH+). The effect is mediated through Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which signal through STAT6. Specific genetic variations (SNPs) in the STAT6 gene are significantly associated with increased risk of developing eczema herpeticum in AD patients. The strongest association was found for a specific 2-SNP haplotype (CT). Some STAT6 genetic variants are also associated with reduced production of IFNγ, a key antiviral cytokine. Transgenic mice with constitutively active STAT6 showed increased vaccinia virus replication, more severe skin lesions, and higher mortality after viral infection compared to wild-type mice.

  This study identifies novel heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) variants in the STAT6 gene as a cause of severe, early-onset, multi-systemic allergic disease. The variants act through a GOF mechanism, leading to sustained STAT6 phosphorylation (due to delayed dephosphorylation), increased STAT6 target gene expression, and a TH2-skewed transcriptional profile. This hyperactivates the IL-4R-STAT6 axis, which is central to type 2 immunity. Patients present with treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, food allergies, asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, and severe anaphylaxis. The condition shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Mechanistic insights led to successful targeted treatments with JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, tofacitinib) and the IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody (dupilumab).

  This comprehensive review details the central role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. The pathway mediates Th2 immune response through IL-4 and IL-13 signaling (activating JAK1, JAK3, TYK2, and STAT6), leading to skin barrier dysfunction, IgE production, and inflammation. It also contributes to Th1 and Th17/Th22 immune responses in chronic phases. STAT6 activation is particularly crucial for IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, which are central to AD pathogenesis. The pathway directly affects skin barrier function and modulates pruritus through cytokines like IL-31. The central role of JAK-STAT signaling makes it an effective therapeutic target, with various JAK inhibitors showing success in AD treatment.

  This review focuses on the role of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis, highlighting its signaling through the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 receptor complex, which results in activation of downstream tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and STAT6. IL-13 is a key cytokine in AD pathogenesis, contributing to skin barrier dysfunction, itch, and inflammation. The IL-13/STAT6 axis is central to the type 2 immune response characteristic of AD. The review discusses therapeutic approaches targeting this pathway, including biologics that block IL-13 signaling.

  This study analyzes the IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 pathway expression in atopic dermatitis patients. STAT6, the signaling molecule from JAK/STAT pathway activated by IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines, plays an important role in IgE production and allergic inflammation. The research demonstrates altered expression patterns of this pathway components in AD patients and correlates these changes with clinical parameters of disease severity.

  Kymera Therapeutics reported positive Phase 1 clinical results for KT-621, a first-in-class oral STAT6 degrader. In the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, KT-621 demonstrated robust STAT6 degradation in blood and skin following low daily oral doses. At higher doses, complete degradation was observed in both blood and skin tissues, a key target in atopic dermatitis. KT-621 showed comparable or superior activity to dupilumab in preclinical models. The drug represents a novel oral approach for blocking the IL-4/IL-13 pathways in development for atopic dermatitis treatment.

  Recludix Pharma is advancing REX-8756, a first-in-class oral STAT6 inhibitor showing promise for safer, targeted treatment of type 2 inflammatory skin diseases including atopic dermatitis. STAT6 is required for IL-4 and IL-13 signaling but is downstream in the disease pathway from other drug targets, making its inhibition potentially more specific with fewer side effects. The development represents a new approach to targeting the central STAT6 transcription factor in allergic inflammation.

  This study reports on a STAT6 gain-of-function variant that exacerbates multiple allergic pathologies including atopic dermatitis with increased dermal collagen fiber deposition. The research demonstrates that overactivity of STAT6 is strongly associated with allergic inflammatory responses. The variant leads to sustained STAT6 activation and contributes to the severity of allergic manifestations, providing further evidence for STAT6's central role in allergic disease pathogenesis.
