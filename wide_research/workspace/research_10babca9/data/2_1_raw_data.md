  In atopic dermatitis, IL-4 and IL-13 are key Th2 cytokines that contribute to skin barrier impairment. They act by downregulating the expression of important terminal differentiation proteins in the skin, such as filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (INV). This detrimental effect on the skin barrier is mediated through the STAT6 signaling pathway. IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier impairment, reducing the expression of terminal differentiation proteins through STAT-6. Furthermore, genetic variants of the STAT6 gene have been linked to an increased susceptibility to allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE levels.

  STAT6 is primarily activated by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which are key drivers of AD pathology. The mechanism involves: 1) Cytokine binding to respective receptors; 2) JAK activation (IL-4 signals through JAK1 and JAK3, IL-13 signals through JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2); 3) STAT6 phosphorylation by activated JAKs; 4) STAT6 dimerization and nuclear translocation; 5) Gene regulation of TH2 immune response genes. Mice constitutively expressing active STAT6 develop an atopic phenotype, while STAT6-deficient mice can develop AD-like lesions via a TH2-independent mechanism.

  The specific pathological effects of STAT6 activation in atopic dermatitis include: 1) Skin Barrier Dysfunction: STAT6 activation leads to downregulation of filaggrin (FLG) expression, directly causing impaired skin barrier; 2) Perpetuation of Inflammation: STAT6 activation promotes production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in keratinocytes, creating a vicious cycle that sustains inflammatory response. STAT6 activation is a central mechanism contributing to skin barrier defects and amplified local inflammation.

  Interleukins -4 and -13 play crucial roles in the type-2-driven inflammation that characterizes AD, contributing to its pathogenesis through STAT6 signaling. The IL-4/IL-13 axis represents a key therapeutic target in AD treatment, with STAT6 serving as the central signaling molecule that mediates their effects on skin barrier function and immune responses.

  IL-4 and IL-13 play a key role in AD pathogenesis, orchestrating effector Th2 immune responses. Both cytokines utilize JAK/STAT signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory responses, with STAT6 being the primary transcription factor activated. The IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6 axis represents a central pathway in AD pathology, regulating both immune responses and skin barrier function.

  Generally, IL-4 and IL-13 utilize Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory responses. STAT6 is the primary transcription factor activated by both cytokines, mediating their effects on gene expression related to Th2 immune responses and allergic inflammation.
