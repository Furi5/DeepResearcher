  This study provides the crystal structure of STAT6 core fragment (CF) and reveals key structural features. The STAT6 CF has conserved domain organization: N-terminal coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD, residues 274-443), linker domain (443-536), and SH2 domain. A unique residue H415 in the DBD is critical for STAT6's preference for N4 site DNA over N3 site DNA, forming direct hydrogen bonds with DNA bases. The SH2 domain facilitates dimerization through interaction with phosphorylated Y641 tail. Upon DNA binding, STAT6 undergoes dramatic conformational change - the protomers rotate significantly, with the DBD shifting by 21.4 Å, resulting in a more compact and stable dimeric architecture. The STAT6 dimer interface has a larger angle compared to STAT1/STAT3, making it more flexible for DNA binding.

  Identifies specific STAT6 mutations in different protein domains associated with severe atopic dermatitis. DNA-binding domain mutations include p.E382Q and p.D419G (most frequent, found in nine patients), while SH2 domain mutations include p.K595. These mutations decrease electro-negativity at the protein-DNA interface, enhancing STAT6 binding to DNA. Structural modeling shows all variants (except p.P643) lie near protein-DNA interface and increase electro-positivity at physiological pH, leading to gain-of-function. Functional consequences include sustained STAT6 phosphorylation, increased target gene expression (IL4R, CISH, XBP1), slower dephosphorylation kinetics, and transcriptional skewing toward T-helper 2 profile driving allergic inflammation.

  The STAT6 SH2 domain is essential for binding to cytokine receptors and dimerization. Mutations in the SH2 domain affect DNA binding, receptor interaction, and tyrosine phosphorylation. The SH2 domain mediates STAT6 binding to phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of activated cytokine receptors, particularly IL-4 receptor. This study demonstrates that specific residues in the SH2 domain are critical for STAT6 activation and function in cytokine signaling pathways relevant to atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.

  Describes the mechanism of STAT6 activation in atopic dermatitis. Once bound to the IL-4 receptor, STAT6 is phosphorylated by JAK kinases, resulting in dimerization via SH2 domains and translocation into the nucleus. The SH2 domain interaction with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Y641) is critical for STAT6 homodimer formation. Gain-of-function mutations disrupt normal regulation, leading to sustained STAT6 activation and excessive Th2 cytokine production characteristic of atopic dermatitis.

  Provides detailed domain organization of STAT6 protein: N-terminal coiled coil domain (residues 130-274), DNA binding domain (DBD, 274-443), Linker domain (443-536), SH2 domain (536-642), and C-terminal transactivation domain. The DNA binding domain contains key residues for specific DNA sequence recognition, while the SH2 domain mediates receptor binding and dimerization through phosphotyrosine interactions. This modular structure allows for regulated activation and DNA binding in response to cytokine signaling.

  Early study establishing the DNA binding specificity of STAT6. Identifies that STAT6 preferentially binds to N4 GAS (gamma-interferon activation site) sequences rather than N3 GAS sites. This DNA binding specificity is mediated by specific residues in the DNA binding domain, particularly those involved in base-specific contacts. The study provides foundational understanding of STAT6-DNA interactions relevant to its role in Th2 cytokine signaling in atopic dermatitis.

  Comprehensive review of STAT6 structure-function relationships. Details how the SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues on cytokine receptors and mediates STAT6 dimerization. The DNA binding domain contains conserved motifs for sequence-specific DNA recognition. Structural studies show that STAT6 undergoes conformational changes upon phosphorylation and DNA binding, transitioning from inactive monomers to active dimers. These structural transitions are critical for STAT6 function in allergic inflammation and atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.

  Demonstrates the critical role of STAT6 in skin barrier function and atopic dermatitis development. Shows that STAT6 activation through IL-4 signaling disrupts skin barrier integrity and promotes Th2 inflammation. The study provides evidence for the structural-functional relationship between STAT6 domains and their role in mediating the pathological changes in atopic dermatitis skin, including impaired barrier function and enhanced inflammatory responses.

  Describes development of STAT6 inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain. AS1517499 specifically inhibits STAT6 activation by blocking SH2 domain-mediated dimerization. This study provides proof-of-concept for targeting STAT6 structural domains for therapeutic intervention in allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis. The inhibitor demonstrates efficacy in reducing Th2-mediated inflammation by disrupting the critical SH2 domain interactions required for STAT6 activation.

  Reviews the conformational dynamics of STAT6 during activation. Describes how IL-4 stimulation induces phosphorylation at Y641, leading to SH2 domain-mediated dimerization and nuclear translocation. The DNA binding domain undergoes significant conformational changes to accommodate specific DNA sequences. These structural transitions are essential for STAT6 function in regulating gene expression programs involved in Th2 differentiation and allergic inflammation, providing mechanistic insights into STAT6's role in atopic dermatitis pathology.
