  STAT6 shares conserved domain organization with other STAT proteins but has unique structural features. The core fragment structure reveals a homodimer with V-shaped architecture. Each protomer consists of five modules: coiled-coil domain (shorter α1 and α2 helices), DNA-binding domain (with unique H415 residue), linker domain, SH2 domain (shorter C-terminal loop), and C-terminal phosphotyrosine tail (Y641 phosphorylation essential). STAT6 has larger angle at dimer interface making it more open and flexible. The key mechanism for DNA recognition involves dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding, with H415 forming direct hydrogen bond with guanine base in N4 site DNA. This residue is the primary determinant for STAT6's specific preference for N4 site DNA (TTCN₄GAA) over N3 site DNA preferred by other STATs.

  STAT6 plays central role in Th2 immune response, the dominant pathway in acute phase of atopic dermatitis. Activated by IL-4 and IL-13 through Type I and Type II IL-4 receptors, leading to phosphorylation and activation. Once activated, STAT6 dimerizes and translocates to nucleus where it regulates transcription of genes causing: skin barrier dysfunction by downregulating filaggrin (FLG) expression, perpetuation of inflammation by promoting production of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in keratinocytes, and IgE production and Th2 cell promotion through B cell activation and IgE class-switching. STAT6 is crucial mediator transducing signals from key Th2 cytokines to skin barrier defects and sustained inflammation in AD.

  Key development is emergence of STAT6 degraders using targeted protein degradation (PROTACs) to eliminate STAT6 protein previously considered "undruggable." KT‑621 (Kymera Therapeutics) is first oral STAT6 degrader in clinical trials - Phase 1 completed in 2025 showing over 90% STAT6 degradation in blood at low doses, Phase 1b in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis began early 2025. Other programs include NX‑3911 (Nurix Therapeutics & Sanofi), KP‑723 (Kaken Pharmaceuticals & Johnson & Johnson). Advantages include oral administration as alternative to injectable biologics, targeting "undruggable" transcription factors through PROTAC technology, and potential for lower cost as small molecules.

  Evidence linking STAT6 gene to increased risk in AD patients for developing disseminated viral skin infections like eczema herpeticum. Functional evidence shows neutralizing IL-4 and IL-13 reduces vaccinia virus replication in ADEH+ skin biopsies. STAT-6VT transgenic mice show worse outcomes after viral skin inoculation with increased viral replication and mortality. Genetic association studies reveal specific STAT6 SNPs (rs3024975, rs841718, rs167769, rs703817) significantly associated with eczema herpeticum history in AD patients. Strongest association with 2-SNP haplotype (CT for rs167769 and rs324013) much more common in ADEH+ patients (24.9%) vs AD without EH (9.2%). STAT6 risk variants associated with reduced IFNγ production, providing mechanism for increased viral susceptibility.

  In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with translocation of transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits OVOL1-mediated epidermal differentiation. STAT6-dependent regulation of Th9 development contributes to AD pathogenesis. The IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6 axis represents key therapeutic target in modern AD treatment strategies.

  STAT6 is activated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate pathogenesis of allergic disorders including asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and allergic rhinitis. Plays critical role in Th2 cell differentiation and function, IgE class switching in B cells, and alternative activation of macrophages. The IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 axis represents central pathway in allergic inflammation with therapeutic targeting potential.

  Summarizes pathogenic and therapeutic implications of IL-13/IL-4-JAK-STAT6/STAT3 axis and AHR axis in AD. The competition between these two axes regulates skin barrier function, with STAT6 activation contributing to barrier impairment while AHR activation promotes barrier restoration. This balance represents important therapeutic target in AD management.

  AK-1690 represents potent and highly selective STAT6 inhibitor. Cocrystal structure shows AK-1690 positioned in SH2 phosphotyrosine binding site of STAT6. The phosphate of inhibitor is critical for binding specificity. This compound provides important structural insights for developing selective STAT6 inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain to block recruitment to phosphotyrosine residues on IL-4 or IL-13 receptors.
