  Dupilumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Rα), inhibiting signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13. The IL-4R complexes, when activated by IL-4 or IL-13, trigger JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK3, Tyk2) leading to phosphorylation of STAT6. By blocking IL-4Rα, dupilumab prevents receptor activation and subsequent STAT6 phosphorylation cascade, thereby inhibiting recruitment and activation of STAT6. This inhibition of the IL-4Rα/STAT6 pathway is the primary mechanism by which dupilumab downregulates Th2 inflammatory response in allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis.

  JAK inhibitors work by blocking the JAK/STAT pathway used by multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines in atopic dermatitis. The STAT6 pathway is specifically involved in Th2 immune response, with IL-4 and IL-13 signaling leading to STAT6 activation. STAT6 regulates T-cell proliferation, Th2 cell differentiation, upregulates GATA3, and promotes IgE class switching. JAK inhibitors like upadacitinib and abrocitinib indirectly suppress STAT6 pathway by blocking upstream JAK enzymes required for STAT6 activation, thereby reducing Th2-driven inflammation. Approved JAK inhibitors for AD include baricitinib, upadacitinib, and abrocitinib.

  Phase 3 trial (JADE COMPARE) evaluating abrocitinib in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At week 12, IGA response rates were 48.4% for 200 mg, 36.6% for 100 mg vs 14.0% for placebo (P<0.001). EASI-75 response rates were 70.3% for 200 mg, 58.7% for 100 mg vs 27.1% for placebo (P<0.001). At week 2, 200 mg abrocitinib showed superior itch response vs dupilumab (49.1% vs 26.4%). Common adverse events included nausea (11.1% in 200 mg group), acne (6.6%), and herpes zoster (1.8%). No major cardiovascular events or thromboembolic events reported.

  Comprehensive review of JAK-STAT pathway role in AD pathogenesis. IL-4 binds to type I IL-4R, stimulating phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, which activate and phosphorylate STAT6. IL-13 signals through type II receptor involving JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, also leading to STAT6 activation. Activated STAT6 dimerizes and translocates to nucleus to regulate gene expression. Topical ruxolitinib, oral upadacitinib, and oral abrocitinib were approved by FDA for AD treatment. JAK inhibitors block multiple cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously, providing broad anti-inflammatory effects.

  Pooled analysis of two phase 3 trials (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) evaluating dupilumab monotherapy in moderate-to-severe AD. At week 16, IGA 0/1 response rates were 37-38% for dupilumab vs 10% for placebo (P<0.001). EASI-75 response rates were 44-51% for dupilumab vs 12-15% for placebo (P<0.001). Significant improvements in pruritus, sleep quality, and quality of life measures. Common adverse events included injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis. No increased risk of serious infections or malignancies observed.

  Review of JAK inhibitors in AD treatment. Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor with high selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In phase 3 trials, upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg demonstrated rapid and significant improvements in EASI, IGA, and pruritus scores. The 30 mg dose showed superior efficacy to dupilumab in head-to-head trials. Safety profile includes increased risk of acne, herpes zoster, and laboratory abnormalities. JAK inhibitors provide rapid symptom relief by targeting multiple cytokine pathways including IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 axis.

  Comprehensive review of AD pathogenesis and treatment advances. In AD, IL-13 and IL-4 activate STAT6, which interferes with translocation of transcription factor OVOL1 and inhibits OVOL1-mediated keratinocyte differentiation. This disruption contributes to skin barrier dysfunction. Dupilumab, by blocking IL-4Rα, inhibits STAT6 activation and restores proper keratinocyte differentiation. The review highlights how targeting STAT6 pathway represents a key therapeutic strategy for restoring skin barrier function and controlling inflammation in AD.

  Comprehensive review of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. STAT6 is mainly involved in transduction of IL-4 and IL-13 signals. IL-4 induces activation of STAT6, which is key to Th2 cell differentiation and function. In AD, aberrant STAT6 activation contributes to Th2 polarization and IgE production. JAK inhibitors targeting this pathway have shown significant clinical efficacy in AD by modulating multiple cytokine signals including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and TSLP, all of which utilize JAK-STAT signaling.

  Review of recently approved AD treatments. Upadacitinib and abrocitinib have the highest short-term efficacy among approved systemic therapies. In responders, dupilumab and JAK inhibitors show comparable long-term efficacy. The review discusses mechanism of action of these drugs, with dupilumab specifically targeting IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 axis, while JAK inhibitors provide broader inhibition of multiple cytokine pathways including STAT6 activation. Safety considerations include monitoring for infections, laboratory abnormalities, and specific adverse events associated with each drug class.
