  STAT6 belongs to the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription family of proteins that transmit signals from receptor complexes to the nucleus. STAT6 is primarily activated by IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines through tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-641) by Janus Kinases, leading to homodimerization and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, STAT6 dimers bind to specific palindromic DNA sequences (TTC(N)3-4GAA) and assemble a large enhanceosome complex including co-activators CBP/p300, NCoA-1, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, p100 (SND1), and RNA helicase A. STAT6 plays a critical role in type 2 immune responses, being essential for Th2 cell differentiation, immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgG1 in B cells, alternative macrophage activation, and protective immunity against helminthic parasites. Dysregulation of STAT6 contributes to allergic diseases including asthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis.

title: "The Transcription Factor STAT6 Mediates Direct Repression of Inflammatory Enhancers and Limits Activation of Alternatively Polarized Macrophages"

  This study establishes that IL-4-activated STAT6 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor for a large set of genes during alternative macrophage polarization, in addition to its well-known role as an activator. The repression mechanism involves HDAC3-dependent recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 corepressor complex at specific enhancers. STAT6-repressed enhancers show extensive overlap with the NF-κB p65 cistrome, and by directly repressing these inflammatory enhancers, IL-4-activated STAT6 attenuates the macrophage's subsequent responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli like LPS. This results in diminished expression of key inflammatory pathway components (NOD-like and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways, including Nlrp3 and Il1b), limited activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, decreased IL-1β production, and reduced pyroptosis. The IL-4-STAT6 signaling pathway not only drives alternative (M2) polarization but also actively represses inflammatory genes, establishing a specific epigenomic signature that limits macrophage activation by subsequent inflammatory stimuli.

title: "Stat6 Is Required for Mediating Responses to IL-4 and for Development of Th2 Cells"

  This foundational study demonstrated that STAT6-deficient mice show profound defects in IL-4-mediated functions including immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgG1, upregulation of MHC class II and CD23 on B cells, and Th2 cell differentiation. STAT6-deficient T lymphocytes fail to differentiate into Th2 cells in response to either IL-4 or IL-13. These results demonstrate that STAT6 is essential for mediating responses to both IL-4 and IL-13, despite the existence of distinct receptor complexes for these cytokines. This established STAT6 as the central transcription factor in Th2 immune responses.

  A germline STAT6 gain-of-function mutation (E372K in the DNA binding domain) causes severe allergic dysregulation characterized by early-onset atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia, extremely elevated IgE levels, food allergies, eosinophilic esophagitis, and recurrent infections mimicking Hyper-IgE Syndrome. The mutation leads to augmented basal and cytokine-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, increased nuclear translocation, enhanced TH2-cell responses, suppressed TH1 and TH17-cell responses, enhanced B-cell class switching to IgE, and reprogramming of regulatory T cells toward a TH2-like phenotype. Treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib successfully reversed STAT6 hyperresponsiveness, improved atopic dermatitis, suppressed eosinophilia, normalized TH1 and TH17 cell levels, and suppressed pathological TH2 skewing, demonstrating that JAK-STAT pathway inhibition is a viable therapeutic strategy for STAT6-driven allergic diseases.

  Dysregulation of STAT6 signaling pathway, often caused by genetic mutations in the STAT6 gene, has been observed in several allergic conditions and tumors. STAT6 plays a crucial role in coordinating cellular responses, particularly those influenced by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. The transcription factor STAT6 is activated downstream of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) and orchestrates multiple facets of immune responses. STAT6 deficiency can promote atopy and autoimmunity, and loss of STAT6 markedly exacerbates autoimmune disease in certain mouse models.

  STAT6 is a classical transcription factor that controls the activation of B cells by regulating its target genes. STAT6 regulates the molecular mechanism of B cell responses and plays crucial roles in allergic reactions, tumors, and autoimmune diseases. In B cells, STAT6 is required for immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgG1, which are crucial for anti-parasite and allergic responses. STAT6 also upregulates antigen presentation molecules (MHC II, CD80, CD86) and the low-affinity IgE receptor (CD23).

  Deficiency of the Th2 transcription factor STAT6 can promote atopy and autoimmunity. Loss of STAT6 markedly exacerbates autoimmune disease in Lyn-deficient mice, demonstrating that STAT6 plays complex roles in immune regulation beyond its classical Th2 functions. This suggests that STAT6 may have protective roles in certain autoimmune contexts through mechanisms that require further investigation.

  STAT6, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in immune responses and is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including by lncRNAs. STAT6 plays a crucial role in coordinating cellular responses, particularly those influenced by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. The STAT6/LINC01637 axis represents a novel regulatory mechanism in cancer progression and immune microenvironment modulation, highlighting the complex regulatory networks controlling STAT6 function in disease contexts.

  Th2 cells at sites of allergic inflammation produce both IL-4 and IL-13, and contribute to the peripheral aspects of allergic immunity. Both IL-4 and IL-13 can signal through the type II IL-4 receptor, which leads to activation of STAT6 and expression of STAT6-dependent genes. Despite structural similarities, IL-4 and IL-13 have distinct but overlapping functions in type 2 immunity, with STAT6 serving as the common downstream signaling mediator for both cytokines.

  An important signaling pathway for the differentiation of T helper type 2 (TH2) cells from uncommitted CD4 T cell precursors is activation of the STAT6 transcription factor. This study demonstrated that STAT6 activation is critical for TH2 cell development and the establishment of type 2 inflammatory responses, establishing the fundamental importance of STAT6 in allergic and anti-parasite immunity.
