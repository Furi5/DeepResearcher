title: "STAT6 Degradation: A Paradigm Shift in Immunology"
authors: ["Kymera Therapeutics"]
year: 2024
journal: "Kymera Therapeutics Perspective"

  STAT6 has been considered "undruggable" for 10-15 years due to its nature as a transcription factor. Traditional oral small molecule inhibitors have proven challenging to develop. Protein degradation technology provides a unique solution through heterobifunctional degraders that directly degrade and clear STAT6 protein. This approach overcomes the fundamental challenge of targeting transcription factors and offers oral administration with potent, catalytic mechanisms that decouple pharmacokinetics from pharmacodynamics. The technology enables oral biologics-level efficacy comparable to upstream injectable biologics like dupilumab.
