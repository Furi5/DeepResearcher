title: "STAT6-dependent and -independent mechanisms in Th2 polarization"

  This comprehensive review outlines both STAT6-dependent and STAT6-independent pathways in Th2 cell differentiation. The classical STAT6-dependent pathway involves IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and activation of GATA3 expression. STAT6-independent mechanisms include: (1) Notch signaling through Jagged ligands promoting GATA3-1a expression and IL-4 production; (2) IL-2/STAT5 pathway inducing IL-4 expression in a GATA3-independent manner; (3) Wnt/TCF-1 signaling stimulating GATA3-1b expression; and (4) mTORC2 signaling indirectly supporting STAT6 activation by downregulating SOCS5. Importantly, low STAT6 signaling can enhance Wnt/TCF-1 pathway by inhibiting repressive TCF-1 isoforms.

title: "Stat6 Is Required for Mediating Responses to IL-4 and for Development of Th2 Cells"
authors: ["MH Kaplan", "U Schindler", "ST Smiley", "MJ Grusby"]
year: 1996
journal: "Immunity"
doi: "10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80439-2"
citation_key: "kaplan1996"

content: |
  This foundational study demonstrates that STAT6 is essential for IL-4-mediated responses and Th2 cell development. STAT6-deficient mice show impaired IL-4-induced proliferation of T cells and B cells, defective Th2 cell differentiation, and reduced IgE production. The study establishes STAT6 as the critical transcription factor mediating IL-4 signaling in immune cells.

title: "STAT6 is required for IL-4-induced germline Ig gene transcription and switch recombination"
authors: ["LA Linehan", "WT Warren", "PA Thompson", "MJ Grusby", "MJ Berton"]
year: 1998
journal: "Journal of Immunology"
doi: "10.4049/jimmunol.161.1.302"

content: |
  This study demonstrates that STAT6 is absolutely required for IL-4-induced germline Ig gene transcription and antibody class switching. In STAT6-deficient B cells, IL-4 fails to induce germline γ1 or ε transcripts, and the synergistic effect of IL-4 with CD40 signaling is completely abolished. Switch recombination to IgG1 is dramatically reduced, establishing STAT6 as an essential mediator of IL-4-induced antibody class switching.

  This review comprehensively summarizes STAT6's critical roles in B cell biology. STAT6 regulates B cell development, activation, tolerance, and function, promoting B cell differentiation and class switching to IgG1 and IgE isotypes. It also regulates germinal center formation and memory B cell development, highlighting its central role in humoral immunity.

  This study reveals that B-cell-intrinsic STAT6 signaling is required for optimal germinal center formation. STAT6-deficient B cells show impaired germinal center responses, reduced affinity maturation, and defective memory B cell generation, indicating that STAT6 signaling in B cells directly controls germinal center biology beyond its role in class switching.

  This study identifies STAT6 gain-of-function variants in patients with severe allergic diseases. These variants lead to hyperactivation of STAT6 signaling, resulting in increased IgE production, eosinophilia, and severe atopic manifestations. The findings establish STAT6 hyperactivation as a direct cause of human allergic disease.
