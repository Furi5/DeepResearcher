title: "Gain-of-function STAT6 variants in severe allergic disease"
authors: ["TD Smith"]
year: 2023
journal: "PMC"
doi: "10.1084/jem.20221755"
citation_key: "smith2023"

  Heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT6 gene cause severe, early-onset, multi-systemic allergic disease. These variants disrupt the IL-4R–STAT6 axis, leading to sustained STAT6 phosphorylation due to delayed dephosphorylation. This results in increased STAT6 target gene expression and TH2-skewed transcriptional profile, driving allergic pathology including treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, food allergies, asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, and severe anaphylaxis.

authors: ["X Li"]
year: 2022
journal: "PMC"
doi: "10.1186/s12890-022-01847-8"

  In mouse models of atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma, STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 demonstrated significant therapeutic effects: alleviated AD symptoms, reduced airway inflammation (eosinophils and lymphocytes), lowered airway hyperresponsiveness, and reduced airway remodeling. The inhibitor modulated immune response by increasing IL-10, decreasing IL-33, decreasing GATA3 expression, and increasing Foxp3 expression. The beneficial effects were achieved through specific blockade of STAT6 signaling pathway, disrupting the inflammatory cascade linking AD to asthma development.
