  Recent inhibition studies have shown that targeting STAT6 signaling reduces tumor growth and/or metastasis in gastric cancer, breast cancer, and Lewis lung carcinoma. However, STAT6's role remains controversial with evidence supporting both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions depending on cancer type.

  STAT6 expression is lost in approximately 3% of breast cancers, but little work has been done in the context of trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer. Loss of STAT6 promotes anchorage-independent growth and contributes to therapy resistance.
