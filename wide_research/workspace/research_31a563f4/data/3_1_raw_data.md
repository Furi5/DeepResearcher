  Vanadium (V₂O₅) induces apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neurons with EC₅₀ of 37 μM. Mechanism involves: 1) Threefold increase in ROS generation (H₂O₂), 2) Mitochondrial cytochrome c release, 3) Caspase-9 (4-fold) and caspase-3 (9-fold) activation, 4) Caspase-3-dependent proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ (72-74 kDa to 41 kDa fragment), 5) Persistent increase in PKCδ kinase activity driving apoptosis. This oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic pathway suggests environmental vanadium exposure may contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

  Vanadium exposure causes: 1) Significant cell death in hippocampal slices, 2) Neuronal loss in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, 3) Dendritic damage with reduced length and arborization, 4) Calcium dyshomeostasis in neuronal processes, 5) Neuroinflammation with astrocytic and microglial activation, 6) Increased TNF-α expression. ZA-II-05 (NMDA receptor antagonist) provides neuroprotection: 1) Concentration-dependent reduction in cell death (peak at 100 μM), 2) Preserved neuronal vitality and dendritic morphology, 3) Attenuated glial activation and neuroinflammation, 4) Downregulated TNF-α expression.

  VO-OHpic, a vanadium-based potent and specific PTEN inhibitor, promotes neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. When combined with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), no additional increase in neurite length was observed, suggesting ChABC promotes neurite outgrowth through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. This indicates vanadium compounds can modulate neuronal growth and regeneration pathways.

  Vanadium exposure induces neurotoxicity through disruption of both NMDA glutamate and dopamine signaling pathways. Mechanism involves: 1) Excitotoxicity via excessive stimulation of NMDA glutamate receptors leading to neuronal damage and apoptosis, 2) Adverse effects on dopamine signaling associated with Parkinsonian pathology. ZA-II-05 demonstrates neuroprotective effects by targeting both NMDA receptors and dopamine transporter (DAT), confirming involvement of both neurotransmitter systems in vanadium-induced neuronal damage.

  Study mentions vanadium (III) chloride in context of neuropathic pain research. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that vincristine damages Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons, establishing relevance to neuropathic pain models. While not directly studying vanadium's effects on DRG neurons, this reference provides context for vanadium compounds in neuropathic pain research.
