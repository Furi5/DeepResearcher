  This study demonstrates that VO₂-based artificial neuron circuits can directly mimic neuronal origins of CNS disorders. By tuning the insulating phase resistance of VO₂ devices, circuits can emulate pathologically altered action potential firing frequencies linked to various disorders. Decreased firing frequency (longer ISI) is tied to CNS depression and cognitive dysfunction, while increased firing frequency (shorter ISI) is linked to seizures, pain, ADHD, and anxiety. The circuits successfully replicate key biological neuron features including integrate-and-fire function and post-firing refractory period. Research gaps identified include: (1) Exploration of other threshold switching Mott semiconductors beyond VO₂, (2) Extension to model more complex statistical behaviors of biological neurons such as spike rate histograms under varying stimuli, (3) Application to model more nuanced, non-uniform neural coding schemes important for functions like olfaction and learning.

  This study investigates vanadium-induced neurotoxicity mechanisms and neuroprotection in hippocampal slices. Vanadium exposure (300 µM) caused significant cell death in rat hippocampal slices, with calcium dyshomeostasis identified as a key mechanism. In neuronal cells, vanadium (500 µM) elicited rapid calcium responses, especially in neuronal processes, indicating disrupted calcium balance linked to neurotoxicity and excitotoxicity. The neurotoxicity is associated with excessive NMDA receptor stimulation and calcium ion influx. The novel NMDA-receptor antagonist ZA-II-05 provided concentration-dependent neuroprotection, showing affinity for GluN2A and GluN2B subunits specifically linked to excitotoxicity. Key research gaps identified: (1) Limited understanding of vanadium's specific molecular targets in pain pathways, (2) Need for systematic investigation of vanadium compounds' dose-dependent effects on different neuronal subtypes, (3) Lack of comprehensive studies on vanadium's interactions with other pain-related receptors beyond NMDA receptors.

  This comprehensive review examines current limitations and future directions for in vitro models in neuropathic pain research. Major limitations include: low translatability of target-based models using recombinant systems; challenging preparation of microfluidic and organ-on-a-chip models; limited availability and heterogeneity of primary neurons; expensive and technically demanding iPSC-derived sensory neuron cultures; and immature differentiation of cell line models. Future directions identified: (1) Development of more translational phenotypic models for disease-related screening, (2) Establishment of screening cascades using scalable models for primary HTS followed by validation in complex models, (3) Leveraging legislative changes emphasizing biologically relevant in vitro models, (4) Advancing target deconvolution using transcriptomics on complex models, (5) Improving human-relevant models through refined iPSC differentiation protocols. Specific gaps for vanadium research include lack of standardized in vitro pain models suitable for screening vanadium compounds and insufficient understanding of how vanadium affects neuronal excitability in disease-relevant contexts.

  This bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive overview of research trends and existing gaps in neuropathic pain literature. Key findings reveal significant research gaps in: (1) Molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in neuropathic pain susceptibility and treatment response, (2) Epigenetic modifications and their role in pain chronification, (3) Glial-neuronal interactions in pain processing, (4) Development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response, (5) Understanding the transition from acute to chronic pain. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated in vitro models that can capture the complexity of neuropathic pain pathophysiology, including multi-cell type co-cultures and organoid systems that better mimic the in vivo environment.

  This review discusses current understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms and treatment approaches. Key molecular mechanisms identified include: sodium channel dysfunction, calcium channel abnormalities, glutamate receptor activation, neuroinflammation, and central sensitization. Research gaps highlighted: (1) Limited understanding of why some patients develop chronic pain while others recover, (2) Inadequate models for studying individual variability in pain perception and treatment response, (3) Need for better understanding of the role of non-neuronal cells in pain maintenance, (4) Lack of effective disease-modifying treatments targeting the underlying pathology rather than symptoms. For vanadium research specifically, gaps include: understanding vanadium's effects on specific ion channels involved in neuropathic pain and developing targeted delivery systems for vanadium compounds to pain-sensing neurons.
