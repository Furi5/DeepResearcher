  Vanadium compounds (vanadate, vanadyl, pervanadate) affect MAPK phosphorylation through several interconnected mechanisms. The overall effect is the activation of MAPK pathways. Vanadium compounds non-specifically inactivate tyrosine-specific and dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), resulting in extended activation time of MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK) by preventing their dephosphorylation. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), vanadate activates the ERK MAPK cascade through an EGFR-independent pathway involving Src kinases activation, which then activate PLCγ, leading to signal transmission via PKC to the ERK pathway. In human lung carcinoma cell line A549, vanadium compounds enhance COX-2 expression by activating EGFR, which causes activation of the p38 MAPK cascade. The p38 MAPK pathway is also involved in regulating the stability of COX-2 mRNA. JNK activation is linked to pathways involving ROS. The inactive form of ASK-1, a MAPKKK that activates JNK and p38, is bound to thioredoxin. Oxidation of thioredoxin by vanadium-generated ROS releases and activates ASK-1, leading to JNK activation.

  Vanadate induces sustained activation of JNK1 in cerebellar granule progenitors (CGPs). The activation is not mediated by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), as catalase did not affect JNK activation. Instead, vanadate acts as a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor, increasing tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins including JNK1 itself. Treatment of cultured CGPs with vanadate activated ERKs and JNKs but not p38 MAPK and also induced c-Jun phosphorylation. The primary downstream effect of JNK activation is the initiation of a Fas-FADD-caspase-8 dependent apoptotic pathway. JNK activation triggers the aggregation of Fas and its association with FADD, leading to activation of caspase-8 and subsequently caspase-3, resulting in neuronal apoptosis.

  After nerve injury, the three MAPK pathways are differentially activated in specific spinal cord cell types, leading to production of proinflammatory and pronociceptive mediators that enhance and prolong neuropathic pain. ERK is activated sequentially in different glial cells - early phase in spinal microglia and late phase in spinal astrocytes, contributing to induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain. p38 is primarily activated in spinal microglia and is critical for pain hypersensitivity following nerve injury, leading to synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α. JNK is primarily and persistently activated in spinal astrocytes and is important for maintenance of neuropathic pain, promoting pain via up-regulation of chemokines like MCP-1. Inhibition of all three MAPK pathways attenuates neuropathic pain in animal models.

  Vanadium exposure leads to oxidative stress through increased ROS generation, causing mitochondrial dysfunction with cytochrome c release into cytosol. This activates caspase-9, which subsequently activates caspase-3. Activated caspase-3 proteolytically cleaves PKCδ, generating a constitutively active 41 kDa catalytic fragment. The activated PKCδ ultimately leads to DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neurons. While this study focuses on PKCδ signaling rather than MAPK pathways, it demonstrates vanadium's neurotoxic effects through oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic mechanisms.

  The study investigated whether MAPK pathways were involved in neuropathic pain mechanisms in rats with chronic constriction injury. Results showed that MAPK pathways play important roles in neuropathic pain development and maintenance. The phosphorylation levels of ERK, p38, and JNK were significantly increased in the spinal cord of neuropathic pain rats, suggesting their involvement in pain signaling pathways.

  p38 MAPK is activated in spinal microglia after nerve injury and contributes importantly to neuropathic pain development and maintenance. p38 activation in microglia leads to synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators that enhance pain signaling. Inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuates neuropathic pain in various animal models, highlighting its critical role in pain hypersensitivity mechanisms.

  JNK activation in spinal astrocytes contributes to neuropathic pain maintenance through up-regulation of chemokine MCP-1 production. Persistent JNK activation in astrocytes following nerve injury leads to increased MCP-1 expression, which enhances pain sensitivity and contributes to central sensitization in neuropathic pain conditions.
