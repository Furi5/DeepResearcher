title: "Positive First-in-Human Results from Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Clinical Trial of KT-621, a First-in-Class Oral STAT6 Degrader"
authors: ["Kymera Therapeutics"]
year: 2025
journal: "Clinical Trial Results"
doi: "NCT06673667"
citation_key: "kymera2025"

content: |
  In the Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers, KT-621 demonstrated robust STAT6 degradation in blood and skin following low daily oral doses. Safety: Well-tolerated with safety profile comparable to placebo, no serious adverse events or severe adverse events, no treatment-related adverse events affecting more than one subject. Efficacy: All doses from 6.25 mg achieved >90% STAT6 degradation in blood, doses ≥75 mg achieved >95% degradation with many subjects below quantification limit. Multiple doses ≥50 mg achieved complete STAT6 degradation in blood and skin. Biomarker effects: TARC median reduction up to 37%, Eotaxin-3 median reduction up to 63%, comparable or superior to dupilumab. Pharmacokinetics: Rapid absorption with median tmax 2-4 hours, half-life 9-36 hours, dose-proportional exposure increases with steady state achieved by day 4.

title: "Recludix Pharma Presents Data Demonstrating Potent Efficacy and High Selectivity of a STAT6 Inhibitor in Preclinical Asthma Model"
authors: ["Recludix Pharma"]

url: "https://recludixpharma.com/recludix-pharma-presents-data-demonstrating-potent-efficacy-and-high-selectivity-of-a-stat6-inhibitor-in-preclinical-asthma-model/"
content: |
  In preclinical allergic asthma models, the reversible STAT6 inhibitor demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction of airway inflammation. Efficacy comparable to anti-IL-4/IL-13 antibody treatments in both preventive and therapeutic dosing regimens. Achieved sustained target modulation by inhibiting phosphorylated STAT6 activity in blood, spleen, and lung without affecting total STAT6 protein levels. High selectivity with picomolar potency for IL-4-driven STAT6 activation, disruption of TARC production, and prevention of Th2 cell differentiation without affecting other immune pathways. Safety: High selectivity avoids broad immunosuppression associated with JAK inhibitors, does not impair growth factor signaling critical for hematopoietic homeostasis.

content: |
  Novel heterozygous gain-of-function variants in STAT6 gene identified as cause of severe, early-onset, multi-systemic allergic disease. Autosomal dominant inheritance with full penetrance. Mechanism: sustained STAT6 phosphorylation due to delayed dephosphorylation, increased STAT6 target gene expression, TH2-skewed transcriptional profile. Clinical presentation: treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, food allergies, asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, severe anaphylaxis within first year of life. Therapeutic approaches: JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, tofacitinib) and IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody (dupilumab) showed clinical improvement in treatment-resistant patients.
