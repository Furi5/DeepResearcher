  This comprehensive review details the extensive network of transcription factors that interact with STAT6 in allergic diseases. Key interactions include:
  - NF-κB (p50/p65 and c-Rel): Direct association and synergistic activation of IL-4-induced transcription, particularly for IgE class switching (Iε promoter), Fcer2a/CD23, and eotaxin (CCL11)
  - PU.1: Synergizes with STAT6 to regulate the germline promoter for IgE (Iε)
  - C/EBPβ: Cooperates with STAT6 to regulate genes like FIZZ1 (involved in allergic inflammation) and arginase 1 in macrophages
  - AP-1 (Fos and Jun): Cooperates with STAT6 at the mouse Iε gene promoter
  - STAT3: Cooperates with STAT6 to promote Th2 cell development and GATA3 expression
  - PPARγ: STAT6 facilitates PPARγ-mediated transcription in macrophages and dendritic cells

  This review focuses on the specific interaction between STAT6 and its co-factor PARP14 in allergic diseases:
  - PARP14 (CoaSt6) directly associates with STAT6 and functions as a transcriptional co-factor
  - Acts as a molecular switch: under non-stimulating conditions, PARP14 recruits HDAC2/HDAC3 to repress transcription; upon IL-4 stimulation, PARP14 mono-ADP-ribosylates itself and HDACs, causing dissociation of the repressor complex
  - Critical for Th2 cell differentiation: regulates STAT6 binding to Gata3 promoter
  - In allergic airway disease models, Parp14-/- mice show reduced lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness
  - In eosinophilic esophagitis, PARP14 expression correlates with STAT6-dependent eotaxin-3 (CCL26) expression

  This recent study on STAT6 gain-of-function variants reveals:
  - STAT6 is intimately linked to allergic inflammation biology
  - In T cells, STAT6 activation induces expression of GATA3, the master regulator of Th2 differentiation
  - STAT6-GOF variants lead to dysregulated STAT6 pathway causing severe allergic disease
  - Demonstrates the central role of STAT6 in coordinating allergic transcription networks
