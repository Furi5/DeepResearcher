  The interleukin 4R (IL-4R)-STAT6 axis plays a critical role in type-2 immunity, and its dysregulation plays a pathogenic role in different allergic diseases. STAT6 is essential for activating immune cells and cytokine gene expression and signaling in airway, skin, and esophageal epithelium. STAT6 is activated by type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which are central to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and eosinophilic esophagitis. This review addresses specific research questions about STAT6 gain-of-function variants in severe allergic disease, including: whether specific STAT6 gene variants are associated with severe, early-onset, multisystem allergic disease; the pathogenic mechanisms of these variants; and potential targeted therapies for patients with STAT6 GOF variants.

  This review provides an update on the genetics of allergic sensitization and five specific allergic diseases: allergic sensitization (AS), atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), food allergy (FA), and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The organization follows the progression of the "atopic march," illustrating how genetic factors may contribute to the sequential development of these conditions. The review addresses key research questions including: genetic risk loci discovery across allergic phenotypes; refining genetic association signals from GWAS; genotype-dependent biological mechanisms; polygenic risk scores for precision medicine; ancestral diversity in genetic studies; and methodologies for connecting variants to genes.

  This methodological paper provides guidance on choosing between systematic reviews and scoping reviews. Systematic reviews can be broadly defined as a type of research synthesis conducted by review groups with specialized skills who set specific research questions. The selection of review type is wholly dependent on the research question. Systematic reviews address clear and answerable research questions rather than a general topic or problem of interest. The purpose of a scoping review is to provide an overview of available research evidence without producing a summary answer to guide clinical decision-making.

  This paper provides a step-by-step explanation of the methods behind systematic reviewing, with five key steps: framing the question, identifying relevant work, assessing the quality of studies, summarizing the evidence, and interpreting the findings. Systematic reviews require clear and answerable research questions, and the question needs to be structured using frameworks such as PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). The framework helps team members clarify and refine the scope of their question.

  This paper discusses that a well-formulated research question should incorporate the components of a 'problem', an 'intervention', a 'control', and an 'outcome'—at minimum. The PICO framework is a model commonly used for clinical and healthcare related questions, often used for searching for quantitatively designed studies. The classical evidence-based approach to formulating a question uses the PICO framework, consisting of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome.

  This study reports the identification of a STAT6 gain-of-function (GOF) variant in a patient who exhibited early-onset multiple allergic diseases. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling pathway plays a central role in allergic inflammation. The research addresses questions about the molecular pathogenesis of patients with early-onset multiple allergic diseases and high serum IgE levels, clarifying how STAT6 GOF variants contribute to severe allergic dysregulation.
