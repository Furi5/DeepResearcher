  Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in JAK-STAT pathways lead to multiple inflammatory phenotypes, including STAT6 GOF variants. These variants cause sustained STAT6 phosphorylation due to delayed dephosphorylation, resulting in increased STAT6 target gene expression and TH2-skewed transcriptional profile that underlies severe allergic disease.

  IL-4 and IL-13 both signal through the type II IL-4 receptor, which leads to activation of STAT6 and expression of STAT6-dependent genes. Despite this similarity, there are distinct signaling mechanisms that modulate STAT6 phosphorylation and activity in allergic responses.

  Aberrant production of the prototypical type 2 cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 has long been associated with the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. These cytokines activate STAT6 through specific receptor complexes and JAK kinases.

  The S1P2-Rho-Rho kinase pathway is necessary for full activation of STAT6 by IL-4/IL-13. S1P did not induce phosphorylation of STAT6 directly, suggesting this pathway does not directly activate JAK-STAT but modulates STAT6 activation.

  STAT6 is clearly required for the development of allergic inflammation. Mice lacking STAT6 expression have greatly attenuated pulmonary inflammation in various allergic models. FIZZ1 participates in allergic inflammation and is regulated by IL-4 from promoters containing functional STAT6 binding sites.
