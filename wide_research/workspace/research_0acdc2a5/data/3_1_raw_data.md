  PM-43I is a potent STAT6 inhibitor that targets the SH2 domain. Key preclinical findings include:
  - Potently inhibits both STAT5- and STAT6-dependent allergic airway disease in mice
  - Reverses preexisting allergic airway disease with very low minimum effective dose (ED₅₀ = 0.25 μg/kg)
  - Significantly reduces airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory cells in BAL fluid, lung eosinophilia, and IL-4-secreting cells
  - Effective via intranasal and aerosol delivery methods
  - Favorable pharmacokinetics with efficient renal clearance and no long-term toxicity
  - Preserves anti-pathogen immunity, showing improved survival in influenza infection models
  - Represents a promising candidate for clinical development against asthma
