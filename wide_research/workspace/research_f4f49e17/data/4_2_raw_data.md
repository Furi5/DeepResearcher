  This study presents pHDock, a computational method that incorporates dynamic protonation states into protein-protein docking. The method successfully predicts large pH-dependent binding affinity changes in the Fc-FcRn interaction system. pHDock improves docking accuracy by accounting for pH-dependent protonation states, which is crucial for FcRn interactions that are highly pH-sensitive.

  This computational study designed monomeric Fc variants with diverse human FcRn-binding profiles. The researchers created mFc mutants including two variants that exhibit 17- and 47-fold stronger FcRn binding at pH 6.0 while maintaining weak binding at neutral pH. The study demonstrates that high-affinity FcRn binding at neutral pH offsets the benefits of increased binding at pH 6.0, highlighting the importance of maintaining pH-dependent binding specificity.

  This study uses machine learning to predict FcRn affinity of new antibody variants, using 1323 Fc variants from 20 patents. The research shows that mutations far away from the interaction site (P230S, P228L, or P228R) could enhance FcRn binding, suggesting allosteric effects. Various machine learning methods were employed to predict affinity changes based on sequence variations.
