  In this review, we attempt to consolidate current data on various interleukins (IL) that participate in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) to further understand their roles and identify potential therapeutic targets. The review systematically examines IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, TSLP, and other key cytokines, with research objectives focused on elucidating their mechanistic roles and therapeutic potential.

  AD is distinguished by strong production of type 2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31, and abnormal and excess Th2 responses. The review scope encompasses detailed analysis of cytokine networks in AD pathophysiology, with research objectives focused on understanding acute phase cytokine responses and their therapeutic implications.

  This review provides an in-depth analysis of current therapeutic approaches and integrates findings from recent biologic studies. Tralokinumab, the second FDA-approved biologic, blocks IL-13 by inhibiting its binding to receptor chains IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. The review scope includes comprehensive assessment of cytokine-targeting biologics and their mechanisms in AD treatment.
