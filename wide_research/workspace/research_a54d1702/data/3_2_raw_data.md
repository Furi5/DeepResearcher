  This study evaluated the novel JAK inhibitor JTE-052 in rodent models of chronic dermatitis. JTE-052 demonstrated potent inhibition of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In mouse models, topical application of JTE-052 significantly reduced skin inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia, and dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells. The compound showed superior efficacy compared to conventional therapies like tacrolimus and betamethasone. JTE-052 also inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation in human keratinocytes, suggesting its potential for treating atopic dermatitis through modulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

  This study reports the first potent small-molecule TSLP receptor inhibitor for atopic dermatitis treatment. The compound demonstrated high potency in disrupting TSLP-TSLPR interactions in vitro. In preclinical models of atopic dermatitis, the inhibitor significantly reduced inflammatory responses and improved skin barrier function. The small-molecule approach offers advantages over biologics in terms of administration and cost. The inhibitor showed promising results in reducing TSLP-mediated inflammation in mouse models, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic option for eczema and other TSLP-driven inflammatory conditions.

  This comprehensive review covers emerging JAK inhibitors for atopic dermatitis treatment. It discusses the role of TSLP, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 in chronic pruritus of AD, all transmitted via the JAK-STAT pathway. The review highlights preclinical data showing that JAK inhibitors effectively block these cytokine signals. It covers novel JAK inhibitors including dergocitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor), and tofacitinib (JAK1/JAK2/JAK3 inhibitor). Preclinical studies demonstrate that these inhibitors reduce inflammation and pruritus in animal models by modulating multiple cytokine pathways simultaneously.

  This review focuses on selective IL-13 inhibitors for atopic dermatitis treatment. Preclinical evidence supports that selective antagonism of IL-13 is sufficient to control AD pathology. IL-13 plays a crucial role in skin barrier dysfunction, itch, and inflammation in AD. The review discusses tralokinumab and lebrikizumab as selective IL-13 inhibitors that have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Preclinical studies demonstrate that IL-13 blockade reduces epidermal thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, and improves skin barrier function in animal models of AD. The selective targeting approach may offer advantages over broader cytokine inhibition.

  This review examines IL-31 as a key therapeutic target for pruritus in atopic dermatitis. Preclinical studies show that mice treated with IL-31 develop skin lesions and scratching behavior similar to human AD. IL-31 directly activates sensory neurons to induce itch. The review discusses nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31 receptor antibody that has shown efficacy in clinical trials. Preclinical validation in animal models demonstrates that IL-31 blockade significantly reduces scratching behavior and improves skin inflammation. IL-31 is considered the "itch cytokine" and its inhibition represents a promising approach for treating pruritus in AD.

  This comprehensive review discusses various animal models used for preclinical testing of atopic dermatitis therapies. It covers mouse models including NC/Nga, flaky tail, and oxazolone-induced models that recapitulate key features of human AD. The review emphasizes the importance of translational models for evaluating novel cytokine targets. Models that exhibit acute phase inflammation with elevated TSLP, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 levels are particularly valuable for testing JAK inhibitors and cytokine-targeted therapies. The paper provides guidance on selecting appropriate animal models for preclinical validation of novel therapeutic targets in AD.

  This comprehensive review provides an update on the role of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis and discusses different strategies for interfering with its biological activity. IL-13 is identified as a crucial cytokine in AD pathogenesis, driving skin barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and chronic inflammation. The review covers preclinical evidence showing that IL-13 inhibition reduces epidermal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and improves skin barrier function in animal models. It discusses the development of selective IL-13 inhibitors and their mechanism of action in blocking IL-13 signaling through IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 receptors. The review emphasizes IL-13 as a key therapeutic target in AD acute phase inflammation.

  This review discusses the translational revolution in atopic dermatitis treatment, focusing on novel cytokine targets. It covers the role of TSLP as an epithelial-derived cytokine that initiates type 2 inflammation. The review highlights IL-31 as the "itch cytokine" playing a key role in pruritus. Preclinical studies demonstrate that targeting these cytokines in animal models significantly reduces inflammation and scratching behavior. The review emphasizes how understanding cytokine networks in AD has led to the development of targeted therapies that are now being validated in clinical trials. It provides insights into the preclinical-to-clinical translation of cytokine-targeted therapies for AD.
