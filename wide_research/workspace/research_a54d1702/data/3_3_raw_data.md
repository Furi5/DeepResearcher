  This comprehensive review delineates the cytokine-mediated crosstalk between keratinocytes and T cells in AD pathogenesis. Key findings include:
  - Keratinocytes release alarmins (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in response to barrier disruption, activating and attracting T cells
  - T cells produce Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31) that feedback onto keratinocytes, inducing further alarmin production
  - In vitro evidence from 2D keratinocyte cultures and 3D human skin equivalents demonstrates:
    * IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit keratinocyte differentiation markers (filaggrin, loricrin) and tight junction proteins
    * IL-31 induces TSLP, CCL17, and CCL22 expression in keratinocytes
    * IL-22 inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and induces TSLP and IL-33 expression
  - Specific signaling pathways identified through in vitro studies include:
    * TSLP activates Th2 cells via JAK1/JAK2-STAT5 pathway
    * IL-4 upregulates TSLP receptor on CD4+ T cells, creating positive feedback loop
    * IL-26 (Th17-derived) induces CCL20 and IL-33 in keratinocytes

  This review provides detailed in vitro evidence for JAK-STAT signaling in AD pathogenesis:
  - IL-4 signals through IL-4R, stimulating phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, activating STAT6
  - IL-13 binds to type II IL-4R, inducing phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, activating STAT3 and STAT6
  - TSLP signals through receptor complex interacting with JAK1 and JAK2, activating STAT5
  - IL-31 engages IL-31Rα–OSMRβ complex, triggering JAK1 and JAK2 activation, stimulating STAT3, STAT5, and STAT1
  - IL-22 induces phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, primarily activating STAT3
  - In vitro studies demonstrate hyperactivation of JAK1 leads to overexpression of cutaneous serine proteases causing skin barrier defects
  - STAT3 activation in spinal dorsal horn amplifies itch sensation

  This study developed a full-thickness atopic dermatitis human skin equivalent (AD-HSE) model using pumpless skin-on-a-chip microfluidic system:
  - IL-4 and IL-13 activated IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 receptor complex on normal human epidermal keratinocytes
  - Stimulation led to activation of JAK1/JAK2/TYK2-STAT6 and STAT3 pathways
  - Cellular responses included:
    * Significant decrease in filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL) expression
    * Strong induction of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) gene expression
    * Morphological changes: spongiosis, acanthosis/hyperkeratosis, impaired stratum corneum
    * Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ)
  - Model recapitulated key AD features including barrier dysfunction and inflammatory cytokine production

  This study investigated cytokine production patterns in PBMCs from AD patients:
  - PBMCs from AD patients showed distinct cytokine production profiles compared to controls
  - In vitro stimulation revealed altered regulation of cytokine production
  - Findings suggest differences in in vivo cytokine production regulation between AD patients and controls
  - Study provides evidence for systemic immune dysregulation in AD through PBMC analysis
