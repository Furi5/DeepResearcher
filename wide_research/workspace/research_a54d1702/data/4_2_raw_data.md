  During the acute phase, damaged keratinocytes release alarmins such as interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in response to various triggers. This review provides an in-depth analysis of current therapeutic approaches and integrates findings from recent biologic studies. Key knowledge gaps identified include the need for better understanding of cytokine signaling crosstalk in acute phase, development of biomarkers for treatment response prediction, and optimization of combination therapy strategies targeting multiple cytokine pathways simultaneously.

  Key knowledge gaps include: lack of universal consensus for dermatological T2T approaches, need for multidisciplinary agreements, challenges in translating omics-based findings into clinical practice, higher costs and accessibility of technologies, need for validation of biomarkers for therapy and prognosis, and more studies on response profiles for different endotypes. Future research directions include: validation studies for biomarkers and endotypes, translational research to convert omics discoveries into clinical benefits, development of standardized T2T criteria and tools, long-term outcome studies, and addressing technology integration and accessibility challenges.

  All patients with AD exhibit a type 2 and type 22 immune responses, but cytokine activation varies, including that of IL-22, IL-17, IL-9, and other cytokines. This heterogeneity presents challenges for targeted therapy. Unresolved questions include the precise temporal dynamics of cytokine expression during acute phase, the role of non-Th2 cytokines in treatment-resistant cases, and the optimal timing for intervention with specific cytokine inhibitors.

  This review discusses latest developments in genetics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metagenomics and how integrating these data can advance precision medicine in AD. Key gaps: incomplete understanding of epigenetic regulation in acute phase cytokine expression, limited longitudinal multi-omics data, and challenges in data integration across different omics platforms. Future research needs: development of dynamic biomarker panels, real-time monitoring technologies, and AI-driven predictive models for treatment response.

  This review outlines current and future directions for novel therapies of AD that are currently being investigated in clinical trials. For systemic therapy, new biologic agents that target IL-13, IL-22, IL-33, the IL-23/IL-17 axis, and OX40-OX40L are being developed. Key research gaps: limited understanding of target redundancy and compensatory pathways, need for better preclinical models that recapitulate human acute phase AD, and optimization of dosing strategies for novel cytokine inhibitors. Future directions include development of bispecific antibodies, small molecule cytokine inhibitors, and combination approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

  Major advances in therapeutics were made in biologic cytokine and receptor antagonists and among Janus kinase inhibitors. Key unresolved questions: optimal sequencing of targeted therapies, management of treatment-emergent adverse events, and long-term efficacy of novel cytokine inhibitors. Future research directions include development of next-generation JAK inhibitors with improved safety profiles, exploration of novel cytokine targets beyond Th2 pathway, and investigation of tissue-specific drug delivery systems.
