  The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is essential to the downstream regulation of various cytokines and growth factors that contribute to a diverse array of cellular processes. In acute phase atopic dermatitis, JAK1 serves as a central kinase in the Th2-driven phase, involved in signal transduction of multiple key Th2 cytokines including IL-4 (with JAK3), IL-13 (with TYK2), IL-31 (with JAK2), TSLP (with JAK2), IL-5 (with JAK2), and IL-22 (with TYK2). JAK2 partners with JAK1 in several critical pathways for acute inflammation and itch, particularly activated by TSLP, IL-5, and IL-31. JAK3 has a more specific role in immune cell signaling, primarily partnering with JAK1 in IL-4 signal transduction through the Type I IL-4 receptor. STAT6 is the key transcription factor for the Th2 immune response, activated primarily by IL-4 and IL-13. Once phosphorylated by JAKs, STAT6 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and acts as a transcription factor for IL-4-responsive genes, driving the Th2 response that leads to skin barrier dysfunction and production of inflammatory mediators.

  This review discusses the central role of JAK1 in acute phase atopic dermatitis pathology. JAK1 serves as a cytokine signaling hub, mediating signals from multiple key inflammatory cytokines upregulated in acute AD: IL-4 and IL-13 (leading to skin barrier disruption and itch), IL-31 (directly activating sensory neurons for pruritus), and TSLP (activating dendritic cells to initiate Th2 immune responses). In acute AD lesions, Th2 and Th22 cells infiltrate the skin, and JAK1 activation from these cytokine pathways drives the core acute phase features: erythema, edema, exudation, intense pruritus, and skin barrier dysfunction. Clinical evidence shows epidermal JAK1 hyperphosphorylation in AD patient skin samples, and mouse models demonstrate that JAK1 hyperactivation induces spontaneous pruritic dermatitis. JAK1's role as a core signal transduction molecule integrating multiple pathogenic pathways makes JAK1 inhibition an effective strategy for treating acute AD inflammation and symptoms.

  IL-13 activates STAT6 through binding to its heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 chains, which activates JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases that subsequently phosphorylate STAT6. The downstream effects of IL-13/STAT6 activation in acute atopic dermatitis include: skin barrier dysfunction through reduced expression of filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin; potent pruritus via direct activation of sensory neurons and enhancement of non-histaminergic itch pathways (TRPA1 channel); skin dysbiosis and infection through decreased antimicrobial peptide production by keratinocytes; and tissue remodeling through down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases leading to dermal thickening. These effects collectively define the inflammation and symptoms characteristic of acute atopic dermatitis.

  This phase 3 trial demonstrated the efficacy of JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib in acute phase atopic dermatitis. At 12 weeks, IGA response rates (lesion clearance or near-clearance) were 48.4% for 200 mg abrocitinib, 36.6% for 100 mg abrocitinib, 36.5% for dupilumab, and 14.0% for placebo. EASI-75 response rates were 70.3% for 200 mg abrocitinib, 58.7% for 100 mg abrocitinib, 58.1% for dupilumab, and 27.1% for placebo. Importantly, at week 2, the 200 mg abrocitinib group showed significantly better itch response (49.1%) compared to dupilumab (26.4%), demonstrating rapid relief of acute pruritus symptoms. Both abrocitinib doses were significantly superior to placebo for all primary endpoints, confirming JAK inhibition as an effective strategy for acute AD symptom control.

  This comprehensive review highlights that JAK1 and JAK3 are particularly related to Th1 cell activation in the acute phase of atopic dermatitis. Multiple studies have shown that STAT6 activation is crucial for Th2 cytokine signaling in AD pathogenesis. The JAK family consists of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, with each member having distinct but overlapping roles in cytokine signaling. In the context of acute inflammation, JAK-STAT pathway dysregulation contributes to the cytokine storm characteristic of inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis. The pathway's central role in transmitting signals from multiple inflammatory cytokines makes it an attractive therapeutic target for acute inflammatory conditions.

  This study provides mechanistic evidence for IL-4 regulation of chemokine CCL26 in keratinocytes through JAK1, JAK2, and STAT6 signaling. The research demonstrates that IL-4 stimulation leads to phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT6 in human keratinocytes, with STAT6 activation being essential for CCL26 induction. This pathway represents a key mechanism by which Th2 cytokines contribute to the inflammatory microenvironment in acute atopic dermatitis, facilitating the recruitment of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells to skin lesions. The findings establish a direct link between JAK-STAT signaling and chemokine production in the pathogenesis of AD.

  This review discusses the clinical application of JAK inhibitors including baricitinib, upadacitinib, and abrocitinib for atopic dermatitis treatment. These agents target the JAK-STAT pathway that is hyperactivated in acute AD inflammation. The review emphasizes that JAK inhibitors provide rapid symptom relief, particularly for pruritus, due to their ability to simultaneously block multiple cytokine pathways involved in acute inflammation. The mechanism involves inhibition of JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3, which are activated by cytokines like IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and TSLP that drive the acute phase response in AD. Clinical trials demonstrate that JAK inhibitors achieve significant improvements in EASI scores and pruritus within weeks, supporting their role in managing acute AD exacerbations.

  This meta-analysis demonstrated that anti-JAK therapy, particularly abrocitinib and upadacitinib, exhibited superiority over dupilumab in achieving fast relief of atopic dermatitis symptoms. The analysis included multiple clinical trials and showed that JAK inhibitors provided more rapid improvement in pruritus and skin lesions compared to IL-4/IL-13 blockade. This supports the concept that targeting multiple cytokine pathways simultaneously through JAK inhibition may provide more comprehensive control of acute inflammation in AD compared to targeting individual cytokine receptors. The faster onset of action with JAK inhibitors makes them particularly suitable for managing acute flares of atopic dermatitis.

  This review details the molecular mechanisms of JAK inhibitors in atopic dermatitis, focusing on their role in acute inflammation. Type I IL-4 receptor signaling is mediated through JAK1/JAK3 with subsequent activation of STAT6, while Type II receptor signaling involves different JAK combinations. The review emphasizes that JAK inhibitors can simultaneously target multiple cytokine pathways involved in acute AD pathogenesis, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, TSLP, and IL-22 signaling. This broad-spectrum inhibition provides comprehensive control of the inflammatory cascade in acute AD, addressing both the immune dysregulation and the neuroimmune components (pruritus) of the disease. The rapid clinical response observed with JAK inhibitors supports their effectiveness in managing acute inflammatory episodes.

  This review discusses the role of JAK-STAT signaling in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and the therapeutic potential of JAK inhibitors. For acute phase lymphocyte activation, Th2 activation is mostly responsible for JAK1, JAK3, and subsequent activation of STAT6 by cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13. The review highlights that in acute AD, there is predominant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by Th2 cytokines, leading to the characteristic inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and pruritus. JAK inhibitors target this hyperactivated pathway, providing a mechanism-based approach to treating acute AD flares. The ability to rapidly inhibit multiple cytokine signals makes JAK inhibitors particularly effective for controlling the complex inflammatory network in acute atopic dermatitis.
