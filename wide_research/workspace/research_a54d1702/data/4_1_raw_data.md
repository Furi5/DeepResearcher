  This comprehensive review assesses the various strategies and novel agents currently being investigated for AD and highlights the potential for a precision medicine approach. The review emphasizes that during the acute phase of AD, the immune response is predominantly driven by Th2 cells, with key cytokines including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and alarmins like TSLP and IL-33. The successful translation of cytokine targets from mechanism to clinic is demonstrated by the approval of dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα), which blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, leading to significant clinical improvement and reversal of the AD molecular signature in the skin.

  This updated review provides detailed insights into the role of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in acute phase atopic dermatitis. During the acute phase, Th2-predominant immune responses trigger the release of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31. These cytokines transmit their signals via the JAK-STAT pathway: IL-4 and IL-13 signal through JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2, activating STAT6; IL-5 activates JAK1 and JAK2, leading to STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 activation; IL-31 activates JAK1 and JAK2, resulting in STAT3 and STAT5 activation. The review highlights FDA-approved JAK inhibitors including topical ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2), oral upadacitinib (JAK1), and oral abrocitinib (JAK1), demonstrating the successful clinical translation of targeting this pathway.

  This review provides comprehensive evidence on the clinical translation of cytokine targets in atopic dermatitis from mechanism to clinic. Key findings include: Th2 pathway (IL-4, IL-13) as the most successful target with dupilumab approval; IL-31 as the "itch cytokine" with nemolizumab demonstrating rapid pruritus reduction; JAK-STAT pathway as broad-spectrum inhibition with multiple approved inhibitors showing high efficacy; OX40/OX40L co-stimulatory pathway showing promise for durable disease modification. The review also documents less successful targets including IL-22 (fezakinumab showing delayed efficacy), IL-17/IL-23 (drugs effective in psoriasis failed in AD), and alarmins TSLP and IL-33 (mixed results in clinical trials).

  This review delineates the distinct roles of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AD, juxtaposing their significance in human AD from clinical trials. It has become clear that for treating AD, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are relevant therapeutic targets during the acute phase, while IL-22 emerges as a target in chronic phases. The review emphasizes the biphasic nature of AD, with Th2 dominance in acute phase and switching to Th1 in chronic stage. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of targeting specific cytokine pathways based on disease phase and patient phenotype.

  This review discusses current knowledge about the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and, specifically, the role of JAK1 in the pathology and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The JAK-STAT pathway modulates the intracellular signaling of key cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, and others. The review highlights that JAK inhibitors that target JAK/STAT signaling, such as baricitinib, upadacitinib and abrocitinib, have shown promising results in clinical trials, with notable reductions in inflammation and pruritus.

  This recent review discusses current approved therapies that primarily target central cytokines of Th2 inflammation, such as IL-4 and IL-13, as well as the JAK/STAT pathway. During the acute phase, damaged keratinocytes release alarmins such as interleukin (IL)-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which initiate the inflammatory cascade. The review emphasizes the evolving therapeutic landscape with biologics like dupilumab and emerging JAK inhibitors showing substantial efficacy and safety in clinical trials.

  This foundational study established IL-31 as a key cytokine in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. IL-31 is most closely related to the family of IL-6–type cytokines known to be involved in many immunomodulatory functions, particularly the acute-phase response. The study demonstrated that enhanced expression levels of IL-31 correlate with IL-4 and IL-13 in atopic dermatitis, establishing IL-31 as a critical mediator of pruritus in AD and paving the way for its targeting in clinical development.

  This comprehensive review establishes IL-31 as a central cytokine in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. In the acute phase AD lesions are dominated by TH2 cytokines, whereas chronic-phase AD lesions contain both TH1- and TH2-derived cytokines. IL-31, secreted by Th2 cells, is identified as a key pruritogen associated with itching. The review summarizes the evidence supporting IL-31 as a therapeutic target and discusses the clinical development of nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31 receptor antibody.

  This review discusses the innovation in atopic dermatitis treatment from pathogenesis to clinical application. PAN-JAK inhibition impacts the signaling of several cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been implicated in chronic inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis, with multiple cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-22, IL-23, IL-31, and others signaling through this pathway. The review highlights the transition from traditional treatments to targeted biologic therapies and small molecule inhibitors.

  This review covers emerging treatments for atopic dermatitis with focus on cytokine targets. The JAK-STAT pathway has been implicated in the signaling of multiple AD-related cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-22, IL-23, IL-31, IL-33, and TSLP. The review discusses the clinical evidence for targeting these cytokines and the successful translation of JAK inhibitors and biologic therapies from mechanistic understanding to clinical practice, highlighting the complete evidence chain from basic mechanisms to clinical applications.
