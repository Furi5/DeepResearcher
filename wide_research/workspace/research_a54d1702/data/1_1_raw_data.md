  During the acute phase, Th2-predominant immune responses trigger the release of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 to promote inflammation and barrier dysfunction. IL-4 and IL-13 are central cytokines in AD pathogenesis, activating through Type I and Type II IL-4 receptors. IL-4 binding to Type I receptor (IL-4Rα and common γ-chain) stimulates phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, activating STAT6. Both IL-4 and IL-13 signal through Type II receptor (IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1), inducing phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, leading to STAT3 and STAT6 activation. This signaling cascade results in downregulation of filaggrin expression, causing skin barrier dysfunction, and increases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-25, IL-33) in keratinocytes.

  The acute phase of AD is characterized by Th2-predominant immune response with IL-4 and IL-13 as key drivers. IL-4/IL-13 axis blockers (monoclonal antibodies) target specific cytokines, while JAK inhibitors broadly inhibit intracellular signaling for multiple cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, TSLP). JAK inhibitors provide faster onset and higher efficacy but with different safety profile including higher risk of acne and herpes zoster. Unmet needs include: only 35-40% of patients achieve clear/almost clear skin with first-line biologics; specific phenotypes like "head-and-neck" dermatitis are often refractory; lack of validated molecular biomarkers for patient stratification; safety limitations in elderly and high-risk populations.

  Many key cytokines involved in AD pathology signal via the JAK-STAT pathway, with JAK1 involved in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-31, TSLP, and IFN-γ signaling. In acute phase AD, these cytokines drive inflammation through JAK-STAT activation. Immune-mediated mechanisms also contribute to skin barrier alterations through cytokine signaling via JAK-STAT pathway. The broad involvement of JAK-STAT signaling in multiple cytokine pathways makes it an attractive therapeutic target for comprehensive AD management.

  Substantial percentage of patients do not respond optimally to approved systemic therapies - only about 40% achieve complete or near-complete response with advanced biologics. Limitations of conventional immunosuppressive drugs and systemic corticosteroids prevent long-term management. Lack of clear definition of remission and treatment goals complicates therapy optimization. Challenges in treating specific phenotypes like psoriasiform AD that are poorly responsive to conventional therapies. Need for diverse delivery methods beyond subcutaneous administration.

  Upregulation of interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-13 lowers FLG expression, which leads to skin barrier defects. A gain of functional polymorphisms of type 2 cytokines contributes to acute inflammation in AD. In acute phase, IL-4 and IL-13 drive the initial inflammatory cascade through their effects on keratinocytes, immune cells, and nerve fibers, establishing the vicious cycle of itch-scratch that characterizes acute AD flares.

  Interleukin-13 is a crucial cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, particularly in acute phase inflammation. IL-13 contributes to skin barrier dysfunction, pruritus induction, and immune cell activation. Together with IL-4, it forms the core of Th2 cytokine response in acute AD, driving the characteristic inflammation through multiple mechanisms including direct effects on keratinocytes and indirect effects through immune cell recruitment and activation.

  Together with IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines suppress the expression of filaggrin and loricrin, generating epidermal barrier dysfunction, and are a source of IL-33 for maintaining inflammation. In acute phase AD, this cytokine triad establishes a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle where barrier disruption facilitates allergen penetration, damaged keratinocytes produce alarmins, and immune cells release more cytokines, amplifying the inflammatory response.

  Th2 cell activation is associated with an upregulation of the cytokines IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, IL-33, OX40 and OX40 ligand. In AD skin, IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to skin barrier impairment through multiple mechanisms. Transgenic expression of interleukin-13 in the skin induces a pruritic dermatitis phenotype, highlighting the central role of this cytokine in acute phase AD symptoms including intense itching and inflammation.
