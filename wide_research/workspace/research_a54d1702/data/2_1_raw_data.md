  IL-4 and IL-13 play crucial roles in the type-2-driven inflammation that characterizes AD, contributing to its pathogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Previous reports have described IL-4 and IL-13 overexpression in acute and chronic skin lesions of patients with AD. IL-4 promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells, which then produce more IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 and IL-19, creating a positive feedback loop. These cytokines are involved in the recruitment of eosinophils, basophils and mast cells and in the release of allergic mediators. IL-4 and IL-13 promote neurogenic itch, which is the hallmark of AD, and contribute significantly to skin barrier function impairment by down-regulating key structural proteins including filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin. They also suppress antimicrobial peptide production, increasing susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus colonization.

  This study demonstrates that IL-4Rα responsiveness on innate T cells regulates acute atopic dermatitis, while on B cells it regulates IgE production. The findings suggest distinct roles for IL-4Rα signaling in different immune cell populations during acute versus chronic phases of AD. Innate T cell IL-4Rα signaling appears to be particularly important for the early inflammatory response in acute AD, while B cell signaling contributes more to the chronic phase through IgE-mediated mechanisms.

  In the acute phase of atopic dermatitis, the production of various Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31 results in barrier dysfunction. IL-4 and IL-13 signal through the JAK-STAT pathway, specifically activating JAK1/JAK3 and STAT6. This signaling cascade leads to the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and pruritus. The JAK-STAT pathway represents a key downstream signaling mechanism for IL-4 and IL-13 in AD pathogenesis.

  The atopic immune response contributes to the skin barrier defect in AD; therefore, neutralization of IL-4 and IL-13 could improve skin barrier integrity. IL-4 and IL-13 significantly suppress filaggrin expression in keratinocytes, which is a key structural protein essential for maintaining skin barrier function. This cytokine-mediated suppression of filaggrin contributes to the epidermal barrier dysfunction observed in acute AD lesions.

  This landmark clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of dupilumab, an IL-4Rα antagonist that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The study showed significant improvements in clinical scores, pruritus, and quality of life measures. The success of dupilumab in treating AD provides strong clinical evidence for the central role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in AD pathogenesis, particularly in acute inflammatory responses.

  Recent evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-13 is a crucial cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). IL-13, along with IL-4, plays a key role in AD pathogenesis, orchestrating effector Th2 immune responses. Both cytokines share the IL-4Rα chain for signaling, but IL-13 also signals through the IL-13Rα1 chain. IL-13 contributes to barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and tissue remodeling in AD. The cytokine is particularly important in the acute inflammatory phase of AD.

  The AD treatment paradigm is now split into two main approaches: targeting the IL-4/13 axis or the JAK/STAT pathway. Both approaches are valid and have strong scientific rationale. IL-4 and IL-13 directly activate the canonical JAK/STAT pathways, specifically JAK1/JAK3 and STAT6. Targeting upstream cytokines (IL-4/IL-13) versus downstream signaling molecules (JAKs) represents different therapeutic strategies for managing acute AD inflammation.

  This study demonstrates that genetic variations in IL-4Rα can influence AD severity. The IL-4Rα Q576R polymorphism is associated with more severe disease and enhanced allergic skin inflammation in mouse models. This provides genetic evidence for the importance of IL-4/IL-13 signaling in AD pathogenesis and suggests that individual variations in receptor function may contribute to disease heterogeneity and treatment response.

  Clinically, acute AD is associated with increased oozing, crusting, and bleeding due to vascular leakage. This study shows that dupilumab treatment significantly reduces vascular permeability in acute AD lesions, demonstrating that IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to vascular barrier dysfunction. The findings provide mechanistic insight into how IL-4/IL-13 signaling contributes to the clinical features of acute AD inflammation.

  IL-4 plays a critical role in skin barrier dysfunction, dysbiosis, pruritus, and inflammation, all of which contribute to the debilitating symptoms of AD. While both IL-4 and IL-13 can signal through the type II receptor, the effects of IL-13 are restricted to cells expressing this receptor, which includes epithelial cells and some immune cells. IL-4 has broader effects through both type I and type II receptors. IL-4 is particularly important in the initiation of acute AD inflammation through its effects on T cell differentiation and barrier function.
