  STAT6 recruits transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 via its carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). STAT6 directly recruits NCoA-1 (SRC-1) via an LXXLL motif in its TAD, with the PAS-B domain of NCoA-1 serving as the specific contact point. NCoA-3 (p/CIP) does not interact directly with STAT6 but is recruited indirectly through p300. PARP-14 associates with STAT6 and acts as a transcriptional switch, recruiting HDAC2/HDAC3 in unstimulated cells and promoting gene activation upon IL-4 stimulation. p100 (SND1) functions as a bridging factor between STAT6 TAD and RNA polymerase II. STAT6 cooperates with NF-κB subunits (p50/p65, p50/RelB) to regulate IgE, CD23, and eotaxin genes. STAT6 also synergizes with C/EBPβ, PU.1, STAT3, and facilitates PPARγ-mediated transcription.

  The NCoA-1-binding site is located at the carboxyl-terminal region between amino acids 792 and 847 of the STAT6-TAD. Mutagenesis of the LXXLL motif eliminated the STAT6/NCoA-1 interaction both in vitro and in vivo, supporting the specific role of this motif in NCoA-1 binding. The amphipathic, alpha-helical STAT6 LXXLL motif binds mostly through specific hydrophobic interactions to NCoA-1.

  PARP14 directly associates with STAT6 in both the presence and absence of IL-4, functioning as a critical transcriptional co-factor. PARP14 acts as a transcriptional switch on STAT6-dependent promoters: at rest, it recruits HDAC2 and HDAC3 to repress transcription; upon IL-4 stimulation, its catalytic activity increases, causing repressor complex dissociation and allowing gene activation. This interaction is crucial for Th2 cell differentiation and production of allergic cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). PARP1 regulates STAT6 protein stability indirectly, with PARP1 inhibition leading to calpain-mediated degradation of STAT6 protein and reduced allergic inflammation.

  The interaction between STAT6 and NCoA-1 is mediated by an LXXLL motif in the transactivation domain of STAT6. The amphipathic, alpha-helical STAT6 LXXLL motif binds mostly through specific hydrophobic interactions to NCoA-1. A single amino acid of the NCoA-1 PAS-B domain makes specific contacts with the STAT6 LXXLL motif, defining the molecular mechanism of coactivator recruitment by STAT6.

  STAT6 phosphorylation leads to dimerization followed by translocation to the nucleus where STAT6 regulates gene expression. Depending on the cell type, STAT6 regulates many pathologic features of lung inflammatory responses including airway eosinophilia, epithelial cell hyperplasia, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. STAT6 is activated by IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate allergic inflammation through its interactions with various co-activators and transcription factors.

  STAT6 has a dual role as signaling molecule and transcription factor. STAT6 is tightly connected to IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and plays a key role in TH2 polarization of the immune system. The review summarizes STAT6 interaction partners including co-activators, chromatin remodeling factors, and other transcription factors that cooperate with STAT6 in allergic inflammation and immune regulation.

  STAT6 and NF-κB physically interact and affect transcription synergistically in regulating CD23 expression and IgE production. This interaction integrates IL-4 and CD40 signaling pathways, with STAT6 and NF-κB binding to proximal promoter elements and cooperating in the regulation of genes critical for allergic responses including IgE and CD23.

  Binding of IL-13 to the type II receptor results in activation of JAK1 or JAK2/TYK2, STAT6, STAT3 and STAT1. STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation occurs following phosphorylation. The IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 signaling axis plays a central role in allergic inflammation through regulation of target genes involved in Th2 differentiation, IgE class switching, and inflammatory mediator production.

  This study identifies heterozygous gain-of-function variants in STAT6 as a novel autosomal dominant allergic disorder. The IL-4-STAT6 axis drives the development and progression of allergic disease and asthma. STAT6 gain-of-function variants lead to enhanced STAT6 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and increased transcriptional activity, resulting in exaggerated Th2 responses and severe allergic inflammation.

  Because the STAT6 transcription factor is an upstream mediator required for interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced Th2 cell differentiation, its targets include key regulators of allergic inflammation. The study provides comprehensive mapping of STAT6 binding sites and reveals the complex network of STAT6 interactions with other transcription factors and co-regulators in Th2 cell differentiation and allergic responses.
