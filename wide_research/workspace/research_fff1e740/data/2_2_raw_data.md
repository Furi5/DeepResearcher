  STAT6 phosphorylation is a central and essential signaling event downstream of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors that drives the pathological features of allergic airway disease. Both the type I IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα/γc) and the type II IL-4/IL-13 receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1) initiate the activation (phosphorylation) of the STAT6 pathway upon cytokine engagement. STAT6 is essential for the majority of the features of asthma. Studies in STAT6-deficient mice show they are protected from antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and mucus production. IL-13, which plays a dominant role in the effector phase of the disease, relies heavily on STAT6 for mucus cell metaplasia, AHR, and fibrosis processes.

title: "Regulation of the Dephosphorylation of Stat6. Participation of Tyr-713 in the Interleukin-4 Receptor Alpha, the Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP-1, and the Proteasome"

  This study demonstrates that the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 is regulated by the action of SHP-1 and the proteasome but is not dependent on new protein synthesis. The results suggest that SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of STAT6, providing a mechanism for terminating STAT6 signaling in allergic responses. Tyr-713 in the IL-4 receptor alpha chain is involved in this regulatory process.

  IL-4 and IL-13 utilize JAK-STAT signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory gene expression and the effector functions associated with disease pathology. Both cytokines signal through the type II IL-4R, which leads to activation of STAT6 and expression of STAT6-dependent genes. The review discusses how dysregulation of this signaling pathway contributes to allergic inflammation and potential therapeutic targeting strategies.

  This study demonstrates that SHP-1 regulates STAT6 phosphorylation and plays a critical role in controlling inflammatory responses. SHP-1 deficiency leads to heightened activation of STAT6 and increased inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that SHP-1 serves as an important negative regulator of STAT6 signaling in immune cells.

  This study developed peptidomimetic compounds based on blocking the docking site of STAT6 to IL-4Rα and phosphorylation of Tyr641 in STAT6. The research demonstrates that targeting the SH2 domain of STAT6 can effectively inhibit Tyr641 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for allergic diseases driven by STAT6 signaling.

  STAT6 has been demonstrated to regulate many pathologic features of lung inflammatory responses in animal models including airway eosinophilia, epithelial cell mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. The review comprehensively covers the role of STAT6 in allergic lung inflammation and its phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanisms.

  This study identified a novel inborn error of immunity due to STAT6 gain-of-function mutation that gave rise to severe allergic dysregulation. The STAT6E372K mutation leads to constitutive STAT6 activation and phosphorylation, demonstrating the critical importance of proper STAT6 phosphorylation regulation in preventing allergic disease pathology.

  The activation of both types of IL-4 receptors leads to the phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK) 1, Jak2, and Tyk2, activating STAT-6. This review discusses how targeted therapy modulating cell signaling pathways, including STAT6 phosphorylation, can be a powerful strategy to design new drugs to treat asthma and other allergic diseases.

  Recent studies provide compelling evidence that supports a role of SHP-1 in regulating mast cell development and function and also in regulating type 2 immune responses. SHP-1 serves as a negative regulator of STAT6 signaling in allergic inflammation, highlighting the importance of balanced phosphorylation-dephosphorylation dynamics in allergic disease pathogenesis.

  STAT6 is activated by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate the pathogenesis of allergic disorders such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and allergic rhinitis. This review summarizes the role of STAT6 in allergic diseases, its interaction with co-factors, and the molecular mechanisms by which STAT6 phosphorylation regulates allergic inflammation, including the critical Tyr641 phosphorylation site.
