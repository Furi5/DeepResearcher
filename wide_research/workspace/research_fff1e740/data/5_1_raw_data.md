  This landmark study identified heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT6 as a novel autosomal dominant allergic disorder. The variants are located in critical domains including DNA-binding domain (p.E382, p.D419), linker domain (p.D519), and SH2 domain (p.K595). These variants decrease electro-negativity near the DNA-binding interface, enhancing STAT6 binding to DNA. The GOF variants lead to sustained STAT6 phosphorylation due to delayed dephosphorylation kinetics, increased STAT6 target gene expression (including IL4R, CISH, XBP1), and TH2-skewed transcriptional profile. Patients present with severe multi-system allergic disease including treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia, food allergies, asthma, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease.

  This study confirms STAT6 as a critical component of the IL-4R-STAT6 axis activated by type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. The GOF variants cause sustained STAT6 phosphorylation and increased target gene expression. The pathology extends beyond pure allergy, with some patients experiencing recurrent infections, short stature, skeletal issues, and B-cell lymphoma. The study demonstrates that JAK inhibitor tofacitinib promotes STAT6 dephosphorylation following IL-4 stimulation, suggesting therapeutic potential.

  Comprehensive review detailing STAT6 structural domains: N-terminal domain (dimerization), coiled-coil domain (protein interactions), DNA binding domain, SH2 domain (phosphorylation and dimerization), and transactivation domain (C-terminal). STAT6 is essential for Th2 cell differentiation, IgE class switching in B cells, and mediates effects in target tissues: airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production in asthma, skin barrier disruption in atopic dermatitis, and eotaxin-3 expression in eosinophilic esophagitis. PARP14 acts as a transcriptional co-factor for STAT6-dependent gene activation.

  Aberrant production of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 is associated with allergic disorders pathogenesis. IL-4 and IL-13 utilize JAK-STAT signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory gene expression. STAT6 activation leads to airway epithelial changes including mucus metaplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, and airway hyperresponsiveness. The review highlights the central role of STAT6 in mediating the effector functions associated with allergic airway disease pathology.

  IL-4 and IL-13 generally utilize JAK/STAT signaling pathways for induction of inflammatory gene expression. The review discusses how STAT6 activation regulates multiple aspects of allergic inflammation including Th2 cell differentiation, IgE production, eosinophil recruitment, and tissue remodeling. Therapeutic targeting of the IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 axis shows promise for allergic disease treatment.
