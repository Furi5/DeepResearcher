  This study provides the first atomic-level crystal structures of phosphorylated STAT6 core fragment (STAT6 CF) homodimer in DNA-free state and complexed with N3 and N4 DNA binding sites. Key structural findings include:
  
  - STAT6 shares conserved domain organization: N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), linker domain, SH2 domain, and C-terminal transcriptional activation domain
  - The SH2 domain features a shorter C-terminal loop (aa 609-620) compared to STAT1/STAT3, resulting in a more open and flexible dimeric structure
  - STAT6 dimer interface angle is larger than STAT1/STAT3, facilitating DNA binding
  - Residue H415 in the DBD is critical for DNA recognition specificity - it's the only residue forming hydrogen bond with DNA base (O6 of guanine at position 14 in N4 site DNA)
  - H415 mutation (H415N) switches STAT6's preference from N4 to N3 site DNA
  - STAT6 undergoes dramatic conformational change upon DNA binding, with H415 moving 21.4 Å to engage DNA
  - Other DNA-interacting residues include K284, K288, K367, K370, K379, and Q418

  This review establishes STAT6 as the central signaling pathway for IL-4 and IL-13 in allergic asthma. Key structural-functional relationships include:
  
  - STAT6 is essential for the majority of pathological features of asthma
  - STAT6-deficient mice are protected from antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production
  - IL-13-induced mucus cell metaplasia and overproduction are STAT6-dependent
  - Reconstitution of STAT6 solely in airway epithelial cells restores mucus production in STAT6-deficient mice
  - IL-13-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is mediated through STAT6 signaling in resident airway cells, particularly epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle
  - STAT6 acts as central hub in signaling cascade triggered by Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13

  This study demonstrates therapeutic targeting of STAT6 SH2 domain in allergic airway disease. Key structural and functional insights:
  
  - Small-molecule inhibitor PM-43I targets STAT6 SH2 domain, blocking recruitment to IL-4 receptor α
  - PM-43I prevents phosphorylation of Tyr641 in STAT6, inhibiting homodimerization and nuclear translocation
  - The inhibitor uses a Freidinger lactam scaffold for conformational constraint
  - PM-43I potently inhibits STAT6-dependent allergic airway disease in mice at very low doses (ED₅₀ 0.25 µg/kg)
  - Effective via aerosol delivery, minimizing systemic exposure
  - Reverses pre-existing disease including airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilia, and lung inflammation
  - No impairment of protective immunity against fungi or influenza viruses
  - Favorable safety profile with efficient renal clearance

  This study develops phosphopeptide mimetics targeting STAT6 SH2 domain for allergic disease treatment:
  
  - Phosphopeptide mimetics target STAT6 SH2 domain to block recruitment to phosphotyrosine residues on IL-4/IL-13 receptors
  - These compounds inhibit STAT6 phosphorylation at Tyr641 and subsequent dimerization
  - The approach provides structural basis for developing small molecule inhibitors of STAT6 signaling
  - SH2 domain targeting represents a promising therapeutic strategy for allergic diseases
