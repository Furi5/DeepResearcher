  This review focuses on the role of the transcription factor STAT6 in the development of T cell-dependent allergic inflammation. The scope covers STAT6 function in several allergic diseases: Allergic Airway Disease (Asthma), Atopic Dermatitis, Food Allergy, and Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). The review expands its scope to include the interaction between STAT6 and its transcriptional co-factor, PARP14, as well as the related factor PARP1. It summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which STAT6 and PARP14 regulate gene transcription and their roles in various cell types, including immune cells and tissue cells like airway epithelia and keratinocytes. The purpose is to summarize the critical role of STAT6 in allergic disorders and highlight the STAT6/PARP14 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for allergic inflammation.

  This review focuses on the modulation of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine signaling in the context of allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. Its purpose is to move beyond the well-described canonical JAK-STAT6 pathway and provide a comprehensive overview of evidence for the activation of non-canonical IL-4/IL-13-induced signaling pathways (e.g., MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, PKC, SRC), the roles of both negative and positive regulators of the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways, and interactions between IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways and other inflammatory signaling programs. Key research questions addressed include: What are the non-canonical signaling pathways activated by IL-4 and IL-13? How is IL-4/IL-13 signaling negatively regulated? What factors positively modulate or enhance IL-4/IL-13 signaling? What is the complex role of the IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2)? How can a deeper understanding of this signaling network lead to better therapies?

  This study identifies heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT6 as a novel autosomal dominant allergic disorder. The research demonstrates that STAT6 GOF variants cause severe early-onset multi-system allergic disease characterized by treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, elevated serum IgE, eosinophilia, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, asthma, food allergies, and severe anaphylaxis. The variants were functionally confirmed to be GOF, leading to sustained STAT6 phosphorylation, increased expression of STAT6 target genes, and T helper 2 (TH2) cell skewing. The study provides strong evidence for targeted therapies like dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα antibody) and JAK inhibitors as effective treatments for this specific genetic defect. This discovery establishes STAT6 GOF as a monogenic cause of severe allergic disease and underscores the central role of the STAT6 pathway in human allergic inflammation.

  This review provides an updated overview on the current understanding of the genetic basis of allergic diseases, highlighting key advances in the field. The scope focuses on the state of knowledge of allergic sensitization and five allergic diseases: asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and eosinophilic esophagitis. The review specifically mentions STAT6 as one of the key genes involved in allergic diseases, along with other important genetic factors. It discusses how genetic polymorphisms in STAT6 and related cytokine signaling pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of various allergic conditions, providing insights into the complex genetic architecture underlying allergic diseases.
